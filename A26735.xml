            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>IT is well known, that the preſent Subject, on which this eminent Author ſo elegantly diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, was not long ſince generally (though moſt injuriouſly) bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the deteſtable Name of Poyſon. This <hi>Odium</hi> was caſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it (as appears by the preſent Book) in the Dayes of the Author; and perhaps, long before that time it might, through the Malice of idle Speculators, be condemned. For thoſe Men, who preſume to be Maſters of all Knowledge, becauſe Letter-learned in the Theory of this or that Art, without the leaſt Skill or Will to exerciſe themſelves in the Practice thereof, muſt needs
<pb facs="tcp:62975:3"/>condemn what they do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand. And this they are induced to do, leſt by approving what they have no Knowledge of, they ſhould too palpably diſcover their Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; becauſe not able to evince the Reaſons of their own Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Therefore, 'tis too too proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that they, hating Labour, and envying the ſedulous Endeavours of others, leſt thereby their own ſeeming Honour ſhould be eclipſed, would rather (according to the Old Proverb) give <hi>Antimony</hi> an ill Name, then foul their Hands in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periencing the Virtues, with which it is endued. How ill it hath been ſpoken of in this our Time, is well known to many; and of how ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able uſe it hath been, in the Cure of very many deplorable Diſeaſes; within twenty years laſt paſt, is as well underſtood by moſt of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly laborious Phyſicians of this City; who can, and dayly do,
<pb facs="tcp:62975:3"/>whenſoever they meet with Men of like Induſtry, teſtify for the Author, that unto <hi>ANTIMONY</hi> is not undeſervedly aſſigned a <hi>CHARI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OT TRI<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>MPHANT.</hi> For none were permitted to enter <hi>Rome</hi> in a Triumphant Chariot, that had not ſlayn at leaſt five thouſand <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> and obtained an intire Victory. Wherefore, if <hi>Antimony</hi> (through the Gift of the <hi>moſt</hi> HIGH inſited in it) more than any one Simple of Nature, be able to ſubdue and expel infinite Diſeaſes (the Enemies of Humane Life) as is undoubtedly known it is, and to obtain an intire Victory over them, why ſhould any Man envy that, by which his own, or his Neighbours, Life is or may be ſo well preſerved? It is true, if taken without Preparation or being ill prepared (becauſe of the much E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil mixt with its great Good) 'tis more injurious than profitable to the Humane Body; which our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
<pb facs="tcp:62975:4"/>well obſerves, teaching ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and laudable Preparations of the ſame. Which Preparations are in no ſmall Meaſure illuſtrated by the preſent Annotations of the Learned <hi>Kirkringius.</hi> Therefore the end of tranſlating anew, and reprinting this Work now a ſecond time in the Engliſh Tongue, was partly becauſe of the aforeſaid Annotations; and partly that ſo Laudable a Work might not be obliterated by time, and by that means the pious and good Intentions of the Author be fruſtrated, but more eſpecially, that our Ingenious Country Men, intent on the Knowledge of Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things, might in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Language find whaſoever is needful and neceſſary for accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing them in the Laudable Studies of the Works of Nature; without being neceſſitated to ſeek forreign Aids, as many heretofore have been conſtrained to do: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb facs="tcp:62975:4"/>what they deſired to be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in, was lockt up in other Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, and could not be unlocked, but by few; who if able, were not alwayes willing ſo to do; and if not able, though willing, could not effect the ſame.</p>
            <p>For this very End, are the Works of <hi>Geber</hi> the famous Arabian Prince, and Philoſopher, now likewiſe tranſlated into Engliſh, ready for the Preſs, and will be ſpeedily pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed. In the mean while, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting all to <hi>GOD,</hi> we heartily wiſh well to all, and to every Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Student in the Practice of Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Phyſick good Succeſs.

            <head>BASIL VALENTINE HIS Triumphant Chariot OF ANTIMONY.</head>
            <p>SInce I, <hi>Baſil Valentine,</hi> by Religious Vows am bound to live according to the Order of St. <hi>Benedict,</hi> and that requires another manner of Spirit of Holineſs, then the common State of Mortals exerciſed in the prophane buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this World; I thought it my duty before all things, in the beginning of this little Book, to declare what is neceſſary to be known by the pious <hi>Spagyriſt,</hi> inflamed with an ardent deſire of this <hi>Art;</hi> as, what he ought to do, and whereuto to direct his aim, that he may lay ſuch Foundations of the whole matter, as may be ſtable; leſt his Building ſhaken with Winds, happen to fail, and the whole Edifice to be involved in ſhameful Ruine, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, being founded on more firm and ſolid Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, might have continued for a long ſeries of time. Which Admonition I judged was, is, and always will be a neceſſary part of my Religious Office; eſpecially, ſince we muſt all die, and no one of us, which now are, whether high or low, ſhall
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62975:10"/>long be ſeen among the number of Men. For it concerns me to commend theſe Meditations of Mortality to Poſterity, leaving them behind me, not only that honour may be given to the Divine Majeſty, but alſo that Men may obey him ſincerely in all things.</p>
            <p>In this my Meditation I found that there were five principal Heads, chiefly to be conſidered by the wiſe and prudent Spectators of our Wiſdom and Art. The firſt of which is, <hi>Invocation</hi> of <hi>GOD.</hi> The ſecond, <hi>Contemplation</hi> of <hi>Nature.</hi> The third, <hi>True Preparation.</hi> The fourth, The <hi>Way</hi> of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſing.</hi> The fifth, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tility</hi> and <hi>Fruit.</hi> For he, who regards not theſe, ſhall never obtain place among true <hi>Chymiſts,</hi> or fill up the number of perfect <hi>Spagyriſts.</hi> Therefore touching theſe five Heads we ſhall here following treat, and ſo far declare them, as that the general Work may be brought to light and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by an intent and ſtudious Operator.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>Invocation</hi> of <hi>GOD</hi> muſt be made with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Heavenly Intention, drawn from the bottom of a pure and ſincere Heart, and Conſcience, free from all Ambition, Hypocriſie, and all other Vices, which have any affinity with theſe, as Arrogancy, Boldneſs, Pride, Luxury, Mundane Petulancy, Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the Poor, and other dependent evils, all which are to be eradicated out of the Heart; that when a Man deſires to proſtrate himſelf before the Throne of Grace, for obtaining bodily health, he may do that with a Conſcience free from all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable Weeds, that his Body may be tranſmuted into an Holy Temple of <hi>GOD,</hi> and be purged from every uncleanneſs. For <hi>GOD</hi> will not be mocked (which I earneſtly admoniſh) as Worldly Men, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and flattering themſelves with their own Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, think: <hi>GOD,</hi> I ſay, will not be mocked, but the Creator of all things will be invoked with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verential
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62975:10"/>fear, and acknowledged with due Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. And for this there is great Reaſon. For what hath Man, that he muſt not own to be received from this his Omnipotent Creator, whether you have reſpect to the Body, or to the Soul, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perates in the Body? Hath not he, for ſuſtentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this, out of his meer Mercy communicated to us his Eternal <hi>WORD,</hi> and alſo promiſed Eternal <hi>Salvation?</hi> Hath not he alſo provided food and cloathing for the Body, and all thoſe things, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which the Body cannot ſubſiſt? All theſe, by humble Prayer a Man obtains of that moſt excellent Father, who created Heaven and Earth, together with things Viſible and Inviſible, as the Firmament, Elements, Vegetables, and Animals. Which is ſo very true, that I am certainly aſſured, no Impious Man ſhall ever be partaker of true Medicine, much leſs of the Eternal Heavenly Bread. Therefore place your whole Intention and Truſt in <hi>GOD,</hi> call upon him and pray, that he may impart his bleſſing to you: let this be the beginning of your Work, that by the ſame you may obtain your deſired end, and at length effect what you intended. <hi>For the Fear of the Lords is the beginning of Wiſdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whoſoever purpoſeth in himſelf to ſeek after that, which is the greateſt of Terrene things, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the knowledge of every good thing, that is in the Creatures, and <hi>GOD</hi> hath liberally imparted to Men, and implanted (as to their effective power) in <hi>Stones, Herbs, Roots, Seeds, Animals, Plants, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, Metals,</hi> yea and indeed in all things; let him caſt away all Earthly thoughts, reject all that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on them, and hope for freeneſs of Heart, and pray unto <hi>GOD</hi> with great lowlyneſs of mind: So doing, his hope of freeneſs may at length be turned into true freedom. Which no Man will doubt, who knows, that he alone is <hi>GOD,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62975:11"/>
               <hi>Iſrael</hi> from all his Enemies; which delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance he did in very deed effect, not only for <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but alſo for all Men making humble ſupplications to him, and praying with brokenneſs of Heart. Therefore let Prayer be the firſt point of our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, which alſo is, and by us is called <hi>Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of <hi>GOD,</hi> which if made, not with Hypocriſie and a feigned Heart, but with ſuch Faith and Truſt, as that, with which the <hi>Centurion</hi> in <hi>Capernaum</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; with ſuch lowlineſs of mind, and confeſſion of Sins, as the <hi>Woman</hi> of <hi>Canaan</hi> was endued with; with ſuch Charity as the <hi>Samaritan</hi> ſhewed to the Man wounded in the Way to <hi>Jericho,</hi> pouring Wine and Oyl into his Wounds, paying his Charges in the Inn, and giving order he ſhould be very carefully looked to; Laſtly, if a Man's Chriſtian Charity ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it ſelf ſo far, as if he obtain what he prays for, he would willingly communicate of the ſame to his Neighbour, then he ſhall undoubtedly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Riches and Health, the end of his <hi>Prayer.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">What the Authour hath premiſed here at large, and elſewhere often inſerted touching <hi>Piety,</hi> the Worſhip of <hi>GOD,</hi> and Invocation of his Name, I purpoſe neither to praiſe nor diſpraiſe; Let them be judged ſigns of his own earneſt <hi>Piety,</hi> Arguments of his ſincerity, and ſignate Impreſſes of his fervent zeal (by ſo many Tautologies and Reiterations) often boiling up. Every Man, according to the Opinion of his mind, and the perſwaſion, in which he was educated from his Childhood, will more or leſs eſteem of this. It was my buſineſs to tranſlate the Authours writings into Latin, in ſuch a Method and Order, as I thought would in no wiſe give any diſtaſte to the delicate <hi>Palat</hi> of the <hi>Reader;</hi> alſo to indicate that, which ſeems pertinent to the buſineſs of every <hi>Chymiſt</hi> and true <hi>Spagyriſt,</hi> and not to neglect the other. For ſince <hi>Piety</hi> is available for all things, as divine Oracles teach, and the principal exerciſe of <hi>Piety</hi> is <hi>Prayer;</hi> by which Celeſtial Gifts are obtained of <hi>GOD</hi> the giver of all good things; our Authour wills, that unto him the mind be lifted up, even in the midſt of the Operations of Chymiſtry full of labour and toil. If Prayer effected no other thing, it certainly collects the mind (called away from all other things) into it ſelf and renders it apt for that, which is in hand; whence it comes to paſs, that it reflects upon many things, and conſiders them, which otherwiſe would not enter the mind, if it ſet about its Work perfunctorily, and diſtracted with various Conceptions: And ſo, by the help of Prayer we receive many things, which we (if not ungrateful) muſt needs acknowledge we have obtained from <hi>GOD.</hi> How often this is found to be of uſe in <hi>Spagyrick Works</hi> every Man knows, that hath any time intirely devoted himſelf to this buſineſs; <hi>viz.</hi> how often thoſe things which he long ſought and could not find, have been imparted to him in a moment, and as it were infuſed from above, or dictated by ſome good <hi>Genius.</hi> That alſo is of uſe in diſſolving all Riddles, or Aenigmatical Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings: For if you burn with a great deſire of knowing them, that is <hi>Prayer;</hi> and when you incline your mind to this or that, variouſly diſcuſſing and medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting many things, this is <hi>Co-operation;</hi> that your <hi>Prayer</hi> may not be idle, or tempting <hi>GOD:</hi> yet this your endeavour is in vain, until you find the <hi>Soluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Nevertheleſs if you deſpair not, but instantly perſist in deſire, and ceaſe not from labour, at length in a moment the <hi>Solution</hi> will fall in; this is <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which you cannot receive unleſs you pray with great deſire and labour, uſing your utmost endeavour; and yet you cannot perceive, how from all thoſe things (of which you thought) which were not the <hi>Solution</hi> of the <hi>Aenigma,</hi> the <hi>Solution</hi> it ſelf aroſe. This unfolding of the Riddle opens to you the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of all great things, and ſhews how available <hi>Prayer</hi> is for the obtainment of things Spiritual and Eternal, as well as Corporal and periſhing goods: and when <hi>Prayer</hi> is made with a Heart not feigned, but ſincere; you will ſee that there is nothing more fit for the acquiring of what you deſire. Let theſe ſuffice to be ſpoken of <hi>Prayer,</hi> which <hi>Baſilius</hi> and all <hi>Philoſophers</hi> with him do not vainly require, as an Introduction to <hi>Chymiſtry.</hi> For <hi>Piety</hi> is profitable for all Works, eſpecially for all <hi>Great Undertakings.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. Next in order after <hi>Prayer</hi> is <hi>Contemplation,</hi> by which I underſtand an accurate attention to the buſineſs it ſelf, under which will fall theſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations firſt to be noted. As, what are the <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances</hi> of any thing, what the <hi>Matter,</hi> what the <hi>Form,</hi> whence its Operations proceed, whence it is infuſed and implanted, how generated by the <hi>Stars,</hi> conformed by the <hi>Elements,</hi> produced and perfected by the three <hi>Principles.</hi> Alſo how the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of every thing may be diſſolved, that is, reſolved into the firſt <hi>Matter,</hi> or firſt <hi>Eſſence</hi> (of which I have already made mention in other of my writings) <hi>viz.</hi> how the laſt Matter may be changed into the firſt, and the firſt into the laſt.<note n="*" place="margin">What are here ſet down, touching the true <hi>Theory</hi> of <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> are Compendiums of thoſe things, which <hi>Philoſophers</hi> have in ſo many Books (writ about the ſame buſineſs) revealed, ſhall I ſay, or concealed. Attend to the words of the <hi>Authour,</hi> and you will ſee, that he perfectly knew that <hi>Spirit</hi> penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all things, which preſides or bears rule in all things, yet is involved and abſconded in matter and defilements on every ſide; from which if once freed, it returns to the purity of its own ſubſtance, in which it produceth all things, and is all in all. To comment upon this, would be a work no leſs than the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of all Books of Philoſophers, compiled with ſuch accurate ſtudy, and contending with ſo great contention about the <hi>Theory.</hi>

            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:62975:12"/>
            <p>This <hi>Contemplation,</hi> which abſolves the ſecond part of our Admonition, is Celeſtial, and to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood with Spiritual Reaſon; for the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and depth of every thing cannot be percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved any other way, then by the Spiritual cogitation of Man: and this <hi>Contemplation</hi> is twofold. One is called poſſible, the other impoſſible. The later conſiſts in copious cogitations, which never proceed to effects, nor exhibit any form of a matter, which falls under the Touch. As if any one ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to comprehend the Eternity of the Moſt High, which is vain and impoſſible, yea a Sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Holy Spirit, ſo arrogantly to pry into the <hi>Divinity</hi> it ſelf, which is Immenſe, Infinite, and Eternal; and to ſubject the incomprehenſive Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of the Secrets of <hi>GOD,</hi> to humane Inquiſition. The other part of <hi>Contemplation,</hi> which is poſſible, is called the <hi>Theory.</hi> This contemplates that, which is perceived by Touch and Sight, and hath a formed <hi>Nature</hi> in time: this conſiders, how that nature may be helped and perfected by Reſolution of it ſelf; how every body may give forth from it ſelf, the good or evil, Venome or Medicine latent in it; how Deſtruction and Confraction are to be handled, whereby under a juſt Title, without So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtical deceits, the pure may be ſevered and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the impu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e. This <hi>Separation</hi> is inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and made by divers manual operations, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62975:12"/>various ways; Some of which are vulgarly known by experience, others remote from vulgar experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Theſe are, <hi>Calcination, Sublimation, Reverbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, Circulation, Putrefaction, Digeſtion, Diſtillation, Cohobation, Fixation,</hi> and the like of theſe; all the degrees of which are found in operating, learned, perceived and manifeſted by the ſame. Whence clearly appears what is moveable, what is fixed, what is white, red, black, blew, or green, <hi>viz.</hi> when the operation is rightly Inſtituted by the Artificer, for poſſibly the Operator may err, and turn aſide from the right way; but that <hi>Nature</hi> ſhould err, when rightly handled, is not poſſible. Therefore if you ſhall err, ſo that <hi>Nature</hi> cannot be altogether free, and releaſed from the Body, in which it is held Captive, return again into your way, learn the <hi>Theory</hi> more perfectly, and enquire more accurately in the method of operating, that you may find the foundation and certainty in Separation of all things. Which is a matter of great concern. And this is the ſecond foundation of Philoſophy, which follows <hi>Prayer:</hi> for in that the ſum of the matter lies, and is contained in theſe words. Seek firſt the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>GOD,</hi> and his <hi>Juſtice</hi> by <hi>Prayer,</hi> and all other things, which Man ſeeks in theſe Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, and he hath need of, either for the ſuſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation or health of his body, ſhall be added to you.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Next to the <hi>Theory,</hi> which ſearcheth out the inmoſt properties of things, follows <hi>Preparation,</hi> which is performed by Operation of the hands, that ſome real work may be produced. From <hi>Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> ariſeth Knowledge, <hi>viz.</hi> Such, as opens all the fundamentals of Medicine. Operation of the Hands requires a diligent application of, it ſelf, but the praiſe of Science conſiſts in experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but the difference of theſe <hi>Anatomy</hi> diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſheth,<note n="*" place="margin">Manual Operation is chiefly required in this third Part, without which, every Operation, like a Ship wanting Ballaſt, floats and is uncertain.

               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:62975:13"/>Operation ſhews how all things may be brought to light, and expoſed to ſight viſibly: but knowledge ſhews the practice; and that, whence the true Practitioner is, and is no other then confirmation: becauſe the operation of the hands manifeſts ſomething that is good, and draws the latent and hidden nature outwards, and brings it to light for good. For, as in Spirituals, the way of the Lord is to be prepared; ſo alſo in theſe things, the way is to be opened and prepared, that no er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour be from the right path, and Proceſs may be made, without devious errours, in the direct way to health.</p>

            <p>For if the Center of the Diſeaſe be within, ſuch a Medicine muſt be given, as can ſearch out, appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend and reſtore that Center: otherwiſe the

            <p>Moreover, if there be an internal Diſeaſe, which ariſeth, and is fed from an internal Original, it muſt never be driven inward by external remedies; for great diſcommodity will thence enſue, and at length Death it ſelf. Which may be underſtood by the ſimilitude of a Tree: for if any one, whilſt it ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates or flowers, repels the Humours to the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, whence they proceeded to the nutriment of the Earth; that Tree will be ſo far from bringing ſorth the deſired Fruit by the flower, that a ſuffoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſame ariſeth from the violent conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of humours not finding any out-let. Therefore there is great difference between freſh wounds in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by Prick, Cut, or any other way, and the old which derive their Original from within. For the freſh wounds may be perfectly cured by external re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies only; but in thoſe, which are nouriſned from within, an external application of Oyls, Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms, Unguents, and Plaiſters proſits little, unleſs the Internal Fountain be ſtopped, whence the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours flow to the external parts. When the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſhall be ſtopped, the Flux will ceaſe, and the evil may eaſily be cured with Diet only. It is no great point of Art to heal any freſh wound; for this every Country-man can eaſily effect with crude Lard: but to remove all Symptomes which happen in wounds, and to dry up the Fountain of the evil, this is the work, and this the labour of the Artiſt.</p>
            <p>Now come hither, you Phyſicians, how many ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there be of you, that arrogate to your ſelves the Title of Doctor of either Medicine, <hi>viz.</hi> of internal and external Diſeaſes; underſtand ye the Title of your honour, and conſult your own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and ſee, whether you received that from <hi>GOD,</hi> that is, poſſeſs it in verity, or whether you uſurp it as a form, for honour ſake. For, as much
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62975:15"/>as Heaven is diſtant from the Earth, ſo vaſtly diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent is the Art of healing internal Diſeaſes, from the Sanation of external wounds. If the Title be given to you by <hi>GOD,</hi> the ſame <hi>GOD</hi> will give a Bleſſing, Felicity, Health, and happy events; but if your Title be vain, and only deviſed and aſſumed for ambition, all things will evilly ſucceed to you: your honour will fail, and you will prepare for your ſelf Hell-fire, which can no more be extinguiſhed, then it can be expreſſed by words. For Chriſt ſaid to his Diſciples; <hi>You call me Lord and Maſter, and ye do well,</hi> Therefore whoſoever aſſumes a Title of Honour, let him ſee, whether he do well, and whether he aſcribes not more to himſelf, than he knows and hath learned, which is the real abuſe of this Title. For he, who will write himſelf Doctor of either Medicine, ought to underſtand, know, and be well skilled in both, <hi>viz.</hi> the Internal and External Medicine. Nor ſhould he be ignorant of <hi>Anatomy,</hi> that he may be able to ſhew the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Body, and diſcover from what Member every Diſeaſe proceeds, together with its Fountain and cauſe. Alſo remedies, with which he may cure the Diſeaſe, and circumſtances of external Wounds, are to be underſtood by him. Good <hi>GOD!</hi> where will the Title be found, what will become of the Maſter, when an exact Trial ſhall be made, for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the ignorance of theſe <hi>Doctors</hi> of either <hi>Medicine?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In times paſt, long before my days, the Doctors of Medicine did themſelves cure External wounds, and judged that a part of their Office; but in theſe our times, they take Servants, whom they employ in theſe things, and this way the nobleſt of Arts is become a Mechanick Operation; and ſome of thoſe who exerciſe it, are indeed ſo very rude, as they know not Letters, and ſcarcely know how (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62975:16"/>to the Proverb) to drive an Aſs out of the Corn. Theſe, I ſay, profeſs themſelves Maſters in curing wounds, and Doctors of Doctors; and to ſpeak the truth as it is, they may by a better right glory in this Title, then thou magnificent Doctor, umbrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Chyrurgion, and moſt ignorant Boaſter of Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, why do you ſtile your ſelf Doctor of either Medicine. What more now Maſter Doctor, what ſay you, moſt expert Chyrurgion? I pray be not offended at this, or take it amiſs; for you your ſelf will quickly confeſs, if you do but ſeriouſly conſider wounds made by Prick or Cut, that you have as much knowledge in the cure of them, as is in the Brain of a dunghil Cock, which Children learning their A. B. C. are wont to ſet in the Frontiſpiece of their Primer.</p>
            <p>Therefore I perſwade all Men, of what ſtate or condition ſoever, who are deſirous of Learning, from your Maſters to ſearch out the true Doctrine, which conſiſts in <hi>Preparation,</hi> and afterward in the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe;</hi> ſo they, or you, ſhall poſſeſs the Title aſſumed with honour, and Men will undoubtedly have confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in you, and you will in very deed do them good, then will you to the Eternal Creator give thanks cordially without feigning. But let every Man ſeriouſly think with himſelf, what it is he ought to do, and what he is to omit, and whether he doth juſtly or unjuſtly uſe the Title aſſumed. For he, who aſſumes any Title, ought eſpecially to underſtand the condition of that Title, and why he aſſumed it, or what the true foundation is. It is not ſufficient, if any one with the vulgar ſay (ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving your reverence, let the more delicate Men pardon us, if we intending to ſpeak to the purpoſe, make mention of putrefaction) this is egregious dung, it hath a ſtrong and grievous ill ſavour, and know not how it comes to paſs, that a Man, who
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62975:16"/>perhaps eats food of a moſt grateful taſte and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, and well accommodated to his natural Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, thence makes excrement endued with quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſo contrary, and yielding an odour ſo very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful, and repugnant to Nature: of which there is no other reaſon, then natural putrefaction and corruption. The ſame happens in all Aromatical well ſmelling things. It is the Philoſophers part to enquire, what odour is, and whence it receives its vertues, and in what the virtue of it may be made manifeſt to true profit. For the Earth is nouriſhed and fatned by ſtinking dung, and noble Fruit is produced of it. Of this matter there is not one cauſe only, but our Book would ſwell to an huge Volume, if we ſhould but briefly hint at all natural Generations and mutations; yet <hi>Digeſtion</hi> and <hi>Putrefaction</hi> are the principal keys of them. For the <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Air</hi> make a certain <hi>Maturation,</hi> by which a Tranſmutation of the <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Water</hi> may follow; and this is alſo a certain mutation, by which of evil ſmelling Dung a moſt fragrant Balſam may be produced; and on the contrary, of moſt grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Balſam ill ſavoured Dung. But perhaps you will ſay, why do I produce examples ſo very rude and abſurd? I do confeſs the example is taken from a Cottage, rather then a Royal Court; yet a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent conſiderer of things, more accurately diving into the matter, will eaſily underſtand, what ſuch examples intimate to him, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the higheſt things the loweſt are made, and of the loweſt the higheſt, ſo that, of a Medicament is produced Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome, and of Venome Medicine; of the ſweet, bitter, acid, and corroſive; and on the contrary of the corroſive, another thing more profitable.</p>
            <p>O good <hi>GOD,</hi> how much is Nature abſconded from Men, ſo that ſhe ſeems to diſdain to be wholly ſeen by us? But ſince thou haſt ordained ſo very
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62975:17"/>ſhort a time of our Life, and thou the Judge of all, reſerveſt many things to thy ſelf in the Creatures, which thou haſt left to be admired, not known, by us, and of which thou alone wilt be the beholder and Judge, grant unto me, that unto my Life's end I may keep thee and my Saviour in my Heart, that beſides health and neceſſaries of the Body, which thou haſt liberally beſtowed, I may alſo acquire the health of my Soul and Spiritual Riches; of which ineſtimable good I am freed from all doubt by that thy mercy, in which, for me a miſerable ſinner, thou didſt (on the Tree of the Croſs) ſhed the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur and Balſom of my Soul; which is indeed a mortiferous Venome to the Devil, but to us Sinners a moſt preſent remedy. I do certainly heal my Brethren, as far as concerns the Soul, by Prayer, and in relation to the body, with apt Remedies; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I hope they will on their parts uſe their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, that they with me, and I with them, may at length inhabit the Tabernacle of the Moſt High, and in him our <hi>GOD</hi> enjoy Eternity.</p>
            <p>But to return to my Philoſophy of <hi>Antimony,</hi> I would have the Reader, before all other things, to underſtand, that all things contain in themſelves operative and vivificative Spirits; which inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the Body feed and nouriſh themſelves, and are ſuſtained by the Body. Elements themſelves want not theſe Spirits, which (the living <hi>GOD</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting that) whether they be good or evil, have their Habitation in them. Men and Animals have in them a living operating Spirit, which receding from them, nothing but a Carkaſs remains. In Herbs, and all things bearing Fruit, a Spirit of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity exiſts; otherwiſe they could not, by any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, be reduced to Medicinal uſe. Metals and all Minerals, are endued and poſſeſſed with their own incomprehenſible Spirit, in which, the power
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62975:17"/>and virtue of all their poſſible effects, conſiſts. For whatſoever is without Spirit, wants Life, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in it ſelf no vivifying Virtue. Therefore, you are to know, that in <hi>Antimony</hi> alſo there is a Spirit, which effects whatſoever is in it, or can proceed from it, in an inviſible way and manner, no otherwiſe, than as in the <hi>Magnet</hi> is abſconded a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain inviſible power, as we ſhall more largely treat in its own place, where we ſpeak of the <hi>Magnet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there are various kinds of Spirits;<note n="*" place="margin">What follow, ſeem ſomewhat confuſed, according to the Sentiments of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Theologicians,</hi> who have held various opinions of Spirits reſiding in the Fire, Air, and other Elements; adjudging them to the Eternal Fire of Hell, &amp;c. All which with <hi>Baſilius,</hi> we leave as unknown, to the Judgement of the Divine Knowledge. But what he himſelf ſubjoyns, touching the wonderful virtue and power of Antimonial and all other Chymical Spirits, which we our ſelves with ſo great admiration have often ſeen, we underſtand only of material Spirits; which certainly are endued with as great virtues, and effect things no leſs won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful then thoſe Spirits, which phantaſtick perſons (oppreſſed with Melancholy) affirm they ſee and talk with; yea I cannot remember that I ever found written or declared (by ſuch, as taking a liberty of lying, endeavour to pleaſe or terrifi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> others) any greater or more wonderful virtues then theſe Spirits have.</note> viſible to the Intellect, and endued with Spiritual know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which notwithſtanding cannot (when they will) be touched or apprehended, as Natural Men are touched; eſpecially they, who have their fixed Reſidence in Elements, as are the Spirits of Fire, Lights, and other Objects formally darting out Light from themſelves: ſuch are <hi>Airy</hi> Spirits, who inhabit the Air; <hi>Aqueous</hi> Spirits living in Waters; and <hi>Terrene</hi> Spirits living in the Earth, which we Men call <hi>Earthly Men,</hi> which are chiefly found in wealthy Mines of the Earth, where they ſhew and diſcover themſelves to us.</p>
            <p>Theſe Spirits are endued with Senſes and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, know Arts, and can change themſelves
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62975:18"/>into divers Forms, until the time of their Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but whether a definitory ſentence ought to be pronounced againſt them as yet, or no, that I leave to the Providence of the Divine Majeſty, from whom nothing is hid. There are other Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, wanting ſpeech, which cannot ſhew themſelves viſibly in the very act; and they are thoſe which live in Animals, as in Men and the like, in Plants alſo and in Minerals; nevertheleſs they have in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves an occult and operative Life, and manifeſt and diſcover themſelves by their efficacious power of operating, which they contain in and bear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout themſelves, and moſt apparently give teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their virtue of healing, whenſoever that (by the help of Art) is extracted from them, being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately ſeparated from their body. After the ſame manner, the efficacious Spirit, and operative power of <hi>Antimony,</hi> manifeſts its gifts, and diſtributes them among Men, being firſt looſed from its own body, and freed from all its bonds, ſo, that it is able to penetrate, and rendred fit to be applyed to thoſe Uſes, which the Artificer propoſed to himſelf in Preparation.</p>
            <p>But the Artiſt and <hi>Vulcan</hi> ought to agree: the Fire gives ſeparation for an operative power, and the Artificer forms the matter. As a Black-ſmith uſeth one ſort of Fire, alſo Iron only is his matter, which he intends for forming divers Inſtruments. For ſome times of it he makes a Spit, at another time Horſe-ſhoes, another time a Saw, and at length innumerable other things, every of which ſerves for that Uſe, unto which the Smith intended it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the matter is but one, which he prepares for ſo many divers uſes. So of <hi>Antimony</hi> various works may be made for different uſes: in which the Artiſt is the Smith that forms; <hi>Vulcan</hi> is as it were the key which opens; and Operation and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62975:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>give experience, and knowledge of the Uſe. O! if fooliſh and vain Men had but Ears to hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Therefore let the World know, that I ſhall prove thoſe pretended Doctors, who ſeem to be wiſe, to be mere Fools and Ideots, and cauſe many unlearned Men (but ſuch as are ſtudious Diſciples of my Doctrine) to become true Doctors in very deed. Wherefore I here ſolemnly cite and invite all Men; who earneſtly aſpire to knowledge, with a chearful mind, good Conſcience, and certain hope, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace and become Spectators of our Doctrine, and accurately to peruſe my Writings and Informations; for ſo, at length, they (being poſſeſſors of what they ſought) will extol and commend me after death, rendring my mortal name immortal, with their perpetual remembrance of my praiſes, as long as the World endures. But if when I am dead, any one be pleaſed to inſtitute a diſputation in the Schools againſt me, my writings will fully anſwer all his Objections, and I am aſſured my Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples will never forget the benefit received from me, by which they will obtain the Empire of Truth, which ever was to me, and always will be to them, ſufficient to ſuppreſs a Lie to the Worlds end.</p>
            <p>Alſo let the well meaning and ſincere obſerver of Art know, that there are two kinds of <hi>Antimony</hi> very different each from other: one is fair, pure, and of a golden property, and that contains very much <hi>Mercury,</hi> but the other which hath much <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur</hi> is not ſo friendly to gold as the firſt, and is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed by fair long and white ſhining ſtreaks.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62975:19"/>Therefore one is more fit for Medicine and <hi>Alchimy,</hi> then the other: as when the Fleſh of Fiſhes is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the Fleſh of other Animals, although both theſe are, and are called Fleſh, yet each of theſe very much differs from the Fleſh of the other; even ſo of <hi>Antimony</hi> the difference is the ſame. Many do indeed write of the Interiour virtue of <hi>Antimony,</hi> but few of them ever taught the true Foundation of the virtues with which it is endued, or found out which way, or in what manner it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives them; So that their Doctrine is founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on words only, exiſts without any true foundation, and they themſelves loſe the Fruit they hoped to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by ſuch Writings. For to write truly of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony</hi> is a work that requires profound Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, a mind largely unfolding it ſelf, and knowledge of its manifold <hi>Preparation,</hi> and of the true <hi>Soul</hi> of it, in which all the Utility is cited, and which being known you may be able to give an indubitate Judgement, of what evil or good, Venome or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine is latent therein. It is not a matter of ſmall moment by a true <hi>Examen</hi> to ſearch into <hi>Antimony,</hi> and thereby to penetrate fundamentally into its Eſſence, and through earneſt ſtudy to attain the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal knowledge thereof, that the Venenoſity of the ſame (againſt which unskilful Men ignorantly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim) may be taken away, and it be changed and prepared into a better State, becoming a Medicine fit for uſe and void of Venome.</p>
            <p>Many Artiſts intending to Anatomize <hi>Antimony,</hi> have divers ways vexed, wreſted and tormented the ſame, in ſuch wiſe as it cannot be well deſcribed in Words, much leſs believed; yet, the matter being truly examined, they effected nothing. For they ſought not its true Soul, and therefore could not ſind the feigned Soul of it, which themſelves ſought. By the black Colours a miſt was caſt before their
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62975:19"/>Eyes, ſo that they could neither obſerve the true Soul it ſelf, nor know it. For <hi>Antimony</hi> like unto <hi>Mercury,</hi> may fitly be compared to a round Circle, of which there is no end; in which the more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently any Man ſeeks, the more he finds, if Proceſs be made by him in a right way and due order. Yet the Life of no one Man is ſufficient for him to learn all the myſteries thereof. It is Venome and a moſt ſwift poyſon, alſo it is void of Venome and a moſt excellent Medicine; whether it be uſed outwardly or inwardly. Which is a thing hid from moſt Men by reaſon of their own blindneſs, and they judge it an incredible, fooliſh and vain work, becauſe (through their ignorance) it is unknown to them, who can no otherwiſe be excuſed, then that they deſerve the name of Stupidity: yet that is not to be ſuffered in them, becauſe they deſire not to learn or be better informed, either here, or elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>

               <hi>Antimony</hi> is endued with all the four firſt qualities; it is cold and humid, and again it is hot and dry, and accommodates it ſelf to the four Seaſons of the year, alſo it is volatile and fixed. The volatile part of it is not void of Venome, but the fixed is free from all venenoſity; which is ſo very ſtrange, as it may be reputed one of the ſeven Wonders of the World, of which ſo many Writers have diſcourſed, not knowing themſelves what they writ. There hath been no<note n="*" place="margin">Here the Authour ſpeaks largely in commendation of <hi>Antimony.</hi> Read, read (I ſay) O Lover of Chymiſtry, and you will find nothing Hyperbolical, nor any thing Thraſonick. <hi>Baſilius</hi> in ſpeaking as he doth, hath not exhauſted the Praiſes of Antimony; becauſe no Man unto this day could ever experience all its Virtues. We have ſeen many of its Effects, and many new Effects are daily found by curious Searchers, yet many more remain unknown. So that, as in Fire is an inexhauſtible Fountain; (for the more you take from it, the more it gives) ſo in <hi>Antimony</hi> is an ineſtimable Treaſure of new Virtues. For if from it you extract its <hi>Acetum</hi> a thouſand times, it will a thouſand times yeild new <hi>Acetum.</hi> Nature ſeems to have made choyce of this Mineral, therein to hide all her Treaſures. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not without reaſon hath <hi>Baſilius</hi> made for it a <hi>Triumphant Chariot,</hi> which is daily enriched with Spoyls taken from the Camps of Ignorance.</note> Man before me, and at this day there is none found, who hath ſo throughly learned the power, virtue, ſtrength, operation, and efficacy of <hi>Antimony,</hi> or ſo profoundly penetrated into all the <hi>Energy</hi> thereof, as nothing more is latent in it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found out, or which cannot be brought to light by experience. If ſuch a Man could be found he would be worthy to be carried about in a <hi>Triumphant Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot,</hi> as in times paſt was granted to Monarchs, and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62975:20"/>potent Heroes, after they had happily fought Battels, and were returned with Victory. But I fear, that many of our Doctors will be conſtrained to provide a Chariot for themſelves.</p>
            <p>For the Maſters of this terrene World are ſo intangled with their own Thoughts, that they ſeek nothing from Antimony but Riches, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get to ſearch its utility for medicine, and the Health of the Body, which notwithſtanding ought above all things to be ſought, that (being brought to Light) the wonderful Works of our <hi>GOD</hi> may be made manifeſt, and the Glory given to him, with great thankfulneſs. It is not to be deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but that more of Riches and Health may be found in it than either you all, or I my ſelf, can believe: for I profeſs my ſelf no other than a Diſciple in the Knowledge of Antimony, although in it I have ſeen, experienced, and learned more than you, and all ſuch as you are (who arrogate to your ſelves great skill therein) either have lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or ever can learn. Yet no Man ſhould therefore be troubled, or deſpair of his well doing, ſince <hi>GOD</hi> wonderfully diſpenſeth his Goods and Benefits; but becauſe the World, indulging their own Ingratitude, have neither eſteemed,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62975:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>nor with due Reverence acknowledged the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence of the Moſt High, but have preferred Riches before Health, <hi>GOD</hi> hath ſpread as it were a Spider's Webb before their Eyes, that being blind they might not know the Secrets of Nature abſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Form of this Mineral.</p>
            <p>All men cry out Rich, Rich we would be. I confeſs you all aſpire to Riches, and with the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picure ſay, <hi>The Body muſt firſt be provided for, the Soul may at length alſo find ſomewhat;</hi> and with <hi>M das</hi> (as in the Fable) you deſire that all things whatſoever you touch may be turned into Gold. Hence it is, that ſo many ſeek their deſired Riches in <hi>Antimony:</hi> But becauſe they accept not that Guift of the Creator with a grateful Heart, which before all Things ſhould be procured, and caſt the Love of their Neighbour behind their back, therefore they in vain look the Horſe in the Mouth; for they know his Age and Strength no more than the Gueſts at the Marriage-Feaſt in <hi>Cana</hi> of <hi>Galilee</hi> knew the wonderful Work, which <hi>Chriſt</hi> there wrought, when he turned Water into Wine. They knew, that Wine was Water, and that the Water was turned into Wine, they perceived by the Taſt; but how that Tranſmutation happened was hid from them. For the Lord JESUS, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, reſerved that Supernatural Work to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as a Teſtimony of his Omnipotency. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſay, it is every Man's duty, to ſearch out the Myſteries and <hi>Arcanums,</hi> which the Creator hath inſited in all Creatures; for although (as we ſaid) it is not Credible, that we Men can through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly learn and penetrate all Things; yet we are not forbid to inquire into them, ſince by Study and Diligence ſo much may be effected, as although through ſome defect a Man be hindred in ſuch wiſe, as he cannot attain to the deſired Riches
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62975:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>and perfect Sanity, yet he may acquire enough to occaſion him not to repent of his Labour, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to miniſter unto him matter of Joy and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing, that he ſees himſelf ſo far an <hi>Adeptiſt,</hi> as he ſtands always obliged to render thanks to his <hi>Creator.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, whoſoever deſires to become a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Anatomiſt of <hi>Antimony,</hi> the firſt thing to be conſidered by him is Solution of the Body; and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to this, he muſt take it in a convenient place, and propoſe to himſelf the right way, that he be not ſeduced into devious Paths. Secondly he muſt obſerve the Governance of the Fire, taking Care that it be neither too much, nor too little, or too hot, or too cold. For the ſumm of all is ſited in an exact Governance of the Fire; by which the vivifying <hi>Spirits</hi> of <hi>Antimony</hi> are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, and looſed from their bonds, and ſo ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered capable to manifeſt their Effects operative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Alſo he muſt take great Care, that this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perative Vertue be not mortifyed and periſh by Aduſtion. Thirdly, the Uſe or Doſe is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by him, that he may adminiſter it in due manner, knowing the Meaſure, as I above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, when I ſpake of the five principal Heads requiſite in the Exerciſe and Practice of <hi>Chymiſtry;</hi> but here I only hint at it curſorily by way of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
            <p>By <hi>Reſolution</hi> the ſum of the Matter is propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but by Fire it is prepared to profit. For a Butcher cuts out an Ox, and divides it into parts, but no Man can profitably enjoy this Fleſh, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he firſt boyl it by Fire, by which Operation the Red Subſtance of the Fleſh is changed and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared into white Aliment. If a Man conſtrained by hunger, ſhould eat that Raw and Red Fleſh, it would be Venom to him rather than <hi>Medicine;</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:62975:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>becauſe the natural Heat of the Stomach is too weak to concoct and digeſt that crude Body. Hence, my dear Friend, you may conclude, that ſince <hi>Antimony</hi> hath greater Venom, and a more groſs Mineral Body than Animal Fleſh (as by the above recited common Example I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſhewed) it will alſo prove more perillous, if uſed Crude, without Preparation, Separation and Coction by Fire; yea it will be and remain Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom, which will ſuddenly kill the Sick. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Venenoſity of <hi>Antimony</hi> is ſo to be taken away, as it may never again be converted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Venom, after the ſame manner, as Wine, which being once, by putrefaction and corruption turned into Vinegar, never afterward yeilds any Spirit of Wine, but always is and remains Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar. But on the Contrary, if the Spirit only of the Wine be ſeparated, and the Aquoſity left by it ſelf, and the ſame Spirit afterward exalted, it will never in any wiſe be changed into Vinegar, although it ſhould be kept an hundred Years; but will always remain Spirit of Wine, no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, then as Vinegar remains Vinegar.</p>
            <p>This Tranſmutation of Wine into Vinegar is a wonderful Thing; becauſe ſomewhat is produced from Wine, which was not before in its vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Eſſence. In which it is alſo to be noted, that in diſtillation of Wine the Spirit firſt comes forth; but (on the contrary) in diſtilling Vinegar the Phlegm firſt comes, afterward the Spirit, as I have ſhewed above in its own place, where I alſo made mention of this Example. Therefore Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Wine makes Bodies volatile, becauſe it ſelf is volatile; but Spirit of Vinegar fixeth all Medicaments, as well of Minerals as Vegetables, and renders them ſolid; ſo that they apprehend things fixed, and expel fixed Diſeaſes.</p>

               <note n="*" place="margin">Beleive not only <hi>Baſilius,</hi> but me alſo, with the ſame Faith and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity affirming to you; This is the firſt-Key, this is the principal part of the whole Art, this opens to you the firſt Gate, this will alſo unlock the laſt, which leads to the Palace of the King. But as I ſaid, not only beleive, but alſo conſider and obſerve. Here you ſtand in the Entrance, if you miſs the Door, all your Courſe will be Error, all your Haſt Ruine, and all your Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom Fooliſhneſs. He who obteins this Key, and knows the Method (which is called Manual Operation) by which to uſe it, and hath ſtrength to turn the ſame, will acquire Riches, and an open Paſſage unto the Myſteries of Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtry.</note>Conſider and obſerve theſe things diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for this principal Key is of great concern. Therefore <hi>Antimony,</hi> which contains in it ſelf its own Vinegar, ought to be ſo prepared, as all its Venenoſity may be taken away, and he, who uſeth it, conceives no Venom thereby, but rather drives away and caſts out all Poyſon from himſelf, by the uſe thereof.</p>
            <p>Therefore Preparation of Antimony conſiſts in the Key of Alchimy, by which it is diſſolved, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, divided and ſeparated; as in <hi>Calcination, Reverberation, Sublimation, &amp;c.</hi> as we declared above of it.

                  </gap>ick</hi> Art and Alchimy; as for Example: If any one would make Beer of Barley, Wheat, or other Corn, all theſe degrees muſt be moſt perfectly known to him, before he can from thoſe Grains extract their moſt ſubtil Eſſence and virtue, and reduce the ſame into a moſt efficacious Drink. Firſt, the Grains muſt be ſo
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62975:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>long ſteeped in Water, as untill they be able ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently, to open and reſolve themſelves (as I, when I was a Young Man, travelling into <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> diligently obſerved to be done in thoſe places) this is called <hi>Putrefaction</hi> and <hi>Corruption.</hi> This Key being uſed, the Water is drawn off from the Grain, and the macerated Corn is laid on Heaps cloſe together, and left ſo for a due time, until it ſpontaneouſly conceive heat, and by the ſame heat germinating, the Grains adhere each to other: this is <hi>Digeſtion.</hi> This being finiſhed, the Grains which adhered in their Germination, are ſeparated, and dryed, either in the Air, or by Heat of Fire, and ſo hardned. This is <hi>Reverberation,</hi> and <hi>Coagulation.</hi> When the Corn is thus prepared, it is carried to the Mill, that it may be broak and ground ſmall; this is <hi>Vegetable Calcination.</hi> After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, by Heat of Fire cocting theſe Grains, the more noble Spirit of them is extracted, and the Water is imbibed with the ſame; which without the aforeſaid Preparation could not have been. This way the crude Water is converted into Beer, and this Operation (though I ſpeak but rudely) is and is called <hi>Diſtillation.</hi> The <hi>Hops,</hi> when ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Beer, is the <hi>Vegetable</hi> Salt thereof, which conſerves and preſerves from all Contraries, endeavouring to corrupt the ſame. This way of boyling Water into Drink, by extraction of the Spirits from the Grains, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Italians</hi> know not, and in my native Soyl of <hi>Germany</hi> about the <hi>Rhine,</hi> few are found skilled in this Art.</p>
            <p>After all theſe works are performed, a new <hi>Separation</hi> is made by <hi>Clarification,</hi> viz. of the Drink, in this manner: a little <hi>Yeſt</hi> or <hi>Ferment</hi> is added, which excites an internal Motion and Heat in the Beer, ſo that it is clevated in it ſelf, and (by the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62975:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>help of time) <hi>Separation</hi> of the denſe from the rare, and of the pure from the impure is made; and by this means the Beer acquires a conſtant virtue in Operating, ſo that it penetrates and effects all thoſe <hi>Ends,</hi> for which it was made and brought into uſe: which before could not have been; becauſe the Spirit, the Operator was hindred, by its own Impurity, from effecting its proper Work.</p>
            <p>In Wine alſo doth not Experience teach the ſame? That cannot, before the time come, in which the Impuritys may be ſeparated from it, ſo very perfectly and efficaciouſly perform its own Work, as after Separation of the pure from the impure: which by Drunkeneſs is manifeſt; for Beer or Wine unſettled, and not purifyed, give not forth from themſelves ſo much Spirit for ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briating, as after Clarification. But of this no more. After all the aforeſaid, a new Operation may be inſtituted, by Vegetable ſublimation, for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of the Spirit of the Wine or Beer, and for preparing it by Diſtillation into another Drink of <hi>Burning Wine,</hi> which may alſo be made of the Lees or Dregs of Wine and Beer. When this is done, the Operative Virtue is ſeparated from its own Body, and the Spirit being extracted by Fire, forſakes its own unprofitable dead Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in which it was commodiouſly hoſpited be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Now, if this <hi>Burning Wine,</hi> or Spirit of Wine, be rectifyed, an Exaltation is made by often diſtilling it, and by a certain method of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perating, the pure part (free from all Phlegm or Aquoſity, may be ſo concentred, and as it were condenſed, as one Meaſure of it may effect more, then twenty or more could have done before. For it ſooner inebriates, and is ſwift, volatile and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til for penetrating and operating.</p>

But ſince unto very few as yet is known, or by Experience found, the Way, by which a Man ought to proceed in theſe Preparations, a very ſmall part of theſe will aſſume and contend for the Opinion I here affirm, and publickly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs: for very many will be carryed away with the greater Rout, crying, <hi>Venom, Venom!</hi> which Voyces, whilſt I hear them, put me in mind of thoſe wild Clamours, by which the <hi>Jews</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the <hi>Saviour</hi> and <hi>Redeemer</hi> of the World, that he might ſuffer the Puniſhment of the <hi>Croſs,</hi> often crying out <hi>Crucify him, Crucify him,</hi> whom they proclaimed to be the higheſt, moſt preſent, moſt pernitious, and curſed <hi>Venom,</hi> when as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he was the nobleſt, ſupreme, moſt glorious and moſt profitable <hi>Medicine</hi> of our <hi>Souls,</hi> which was to deliver us from the Death of <hi>Simers,</hi> from the <hi>Devil, Hell</hi> and all <hi>Misfortunes.</hi> Although thoſe proud <hi>Phariſees</hi> and Lawyers neither could nor would underſtand this, nevertheleſs he both then was, and will be to the end of the <hi>World,</hi> and after it to all <hi>Eternity,</hi> the ſame ſuperexcellent <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine:</hi> and neither the <hi>Devil,</hi> nor Death, nor the very Gates of <hi>Hell,</hi> nor any <hi>Creature,</hi> how power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, or perverſe ſoever, can effect any thing at all, whereby to overthrow this Truth.</p>
            <p>So I hope, yea doubt not (although all vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bond and circumforaneous <hi>Medicaſters,</hi> all <hi>Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:62975:26"/>reſident in <hi>Cities,</hi> and how many ſoever there be, that profeſs themſelves <hi>Maſters</hi> of any part of <hi>Medicine,</hi> do all together contrive what they can, and exclaim againſt <hi>Antimony</hi>) but that the ſame <hi>Antimony</hi> will triumph over the ingratitudes of all thoſe unskilful Men (for true <hi>Phyſitians</hi> and ſuch as are always ready to learn, I touch not here) and by its own power and virtue acquired after due preparation, will overcome and tread un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foot all its Enemies. But, on the contrary, thoſe ignorant falſe Judges, and pertinacious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temners of <hi>Antimony,</hi> becauſe they know not the Truth, together with the proud and blood-thirſty <hi>Jews,</hi> ſhall periſh, and be caſt into the Abyſs of Hell. How ridiculous thoſe magnificent, and to themſelves only wiſe <hi>Doctors,</hi> ſeem to me, who deterr <hi>Emperors, Kings, Princes,</hi> and all other <hi>Great Men,</hi> and ſeriouſly admoniſh them not ſo much as to touch ſuch <hi>Medicines</hi> with their Lips, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are noxious, venomous, and every way perillous, I will not here declare, ſince I ſee them only to judge according to their own Opinion, without entertaining any Obſervations of other things, the Knowledge of which they have not before acquired by their own Contemplation, and therefore cannot judge of any thing elſe, or otherwiſe than they have learned. Therefore to theſe I ſay, if there be any Man, that hath taken ſo ſtrong a <hi>Poyſon,</hi> as preſent Death is neceſſarily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to follow, I will (provided the Man be left wholly to my Care) give him an <hi>Antidote</hi> by me prepared which ſhall continually reſiſt that <hi>Venom,</hi> and quickly expel it out of the Body. But I little care, whether you Mr. <hi>Doctor,</hi> who do neither know this Thing, nor ever would apply your mind to know it, do ſlight the ſame, and repute it as a ridiculous, and altogether falſe tale;
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62975:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>it is ſufficient for me, that I am able (but if praiſe worthy, let praiſe be given to <hi>GOD</hi>) to prove and defend the Truth thereof. For I my ſelf have experienced it, I have made, I have prepared, I have preſcribed this Medicine, and there wants not a ſufficient number of Witneſſes to confirm it under Hand and Seal.</p>
            <p>And whenſoever I ſhall have occaſion to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend in the School with ſuch a Doctor, who knows not how himſelf to prepare his own Medicines, but commits that Buſineſs to another, I am ſure I ſhall obtain the Palm from her: for indeed that good Man knows not what Medicines he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes to the Sick; whether the Colour of them be white, black, grey or blew, he cannot tell; nor doth this wretched man know, whether the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cament he gives be dry or hot, cold or humid; but he only knows, that he found it ſo written in his Books, and thence pretends Poſſeſſion (or as it were Poſſeſſion) by Preſcription of a very long time: yet he deſires no further Information. Here again let it be lawful to exclaim, good <hi>GOD,</hi> to what a ſtate is the matter brought! what goodneſs of mind is in theſe men! what care do they take of the Sick! Wo, wo to them! in the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they will find the fruit of their ignorance and raſhneſs; then they will ſee him whom they pierced, when they neglected their Neighbour, ſought after Money and nothing elſe: whereas were they cordial in their Profeſſion, they would ſpend Nights and Days in Labour, that they might become more learned in their Art, whence more certain health would accrew to the Sick with their Eſtimation, and greater glory to themſelves. But ſince Labour is tedious to them, they commit the matter to Chance, and being ſecure of their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and content with their Fame, they (like Braw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers)
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62975:27"/>defend themſelves with a certain Garrulity, without any reſpect had to Conſcience or Truth; Coals ſeem wonderful ſtrange, and as out-landiſh Wares to them, therefore they ſpare the Money, that ſhould be beſtowed in them, as if they intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to lay it out to a better uſe. <hi>Vulcan</hi> himſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> the Prepairer of Medicaments, is not found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them; for their Fornaces ſtand in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries Shop, to which they ſeldom or never come. A Paper Scrol in which their uſual <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipe</hi> is written, ſerves their purpoſe to the full, which Bill being by ſome Apothecaries Boy or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant received, he with great noyſe thumps out of his Mortar every Medicine, and all the Health of the Sick.</p>
            <p>My <hi>GOD,</hi> change, change theſe times, and and put an end to this arrogant Pride, overturn thoſe Trees, leſt they ſwell up to Heaven, throw down thoſe Giants leſt they accumulate all Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; and defend thoſe, who ſeriouſly managing their Buſineſs, faithfully ſerve thee, that they may be able to ſtand againſt theſe their Perſecutors. I ſeriouſly admoniſh all thoſe in our Monaſtery, bound by the ſame Vows with me, that they would with my ſelf Night and Day pray unto <hi>GOD,</hi> that he would ſo illuminate theſe Enemies of true Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, as they may execrate their own Error, and acknowledge the Glory of <hi>GOD,</hi> and his Power inſited in the Creatures, and perceive the Clearneſs latent in them, by Preparation and Anatomy (as it were ſpeaking in their Ears) which otherwiſe ſurrounded and covered over with external Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, would deeply be concealed, and never brought to Light. But I truſt the <hi>Creator</hi> of all Things, (both of thoſe which fall under our Senſe, and of thoſe that are remote from our Senſes) will benignly hear our Prayers; that, if not whilſt I
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62975:27"/>and my Brethren live, yet after our Death, ſuch a Converſion of Things and Men (<hi>GOD</hi> anſwer theſe Deſires) may follow, as that thick and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Veil may be taken away from the Eyes of our Enemies, and they by true and infallible Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, obtain a clear ſight, that they may find their loſt Groat: which <hi>GOD</hi> the eternal Governour of Times and Things of his Grace and Mercy grant.</p>
            <p>But it is ſit, that I, who intended to publiſh a certain Diſcourſe of Antimony, in all its Numbers abſolute, ſhould begin with the<note n="*" place="margin">Poets do often poſit in the midſt of their <hi>Poems,</hi> Hiſtories or Fables of Princes, that by a continued Series of Things, they may the more eaſily attain their End, which is to delight their Readers: <hi>Chymiſts</hi> for another end uſe the ſame <hi>Medium.</hi> For ſince their purpoſe is to teach the Readers ſo, as they may only be underſtood by thoſe, who wholly devote themſelves with a ſervent deſire to the Study of that Science, they keep not that Order, which proceeds from the beginning to the End by Mediums. Therefore our <hi>Author,</hi> at length coming to treat of the Name of <hi>Antimony,</hi> whence it took beginning, acts as another Man addicted to ſome Scholaſtick Order: but by and by turning from this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourſe, he anſwers an Objection, before it is made by Interiogation; <hi>viz.</hi> whether from <hi>Antimony</hi> all its Venome may be taken away, the poſſibility of which he pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The <hi>Arabians,</hi> to whom in times paſt this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral was known, did in their Language call it <hi>Aſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat;</hi> but the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> called it <hi>Stibium;</hi> among the <hi>Latines</hi> at this day the Name of <hi>Antimony</hi> is uſed, by which name they firſt of all ſignified it. We <hi>Germans</hi> in our Language have given it a Name, which ſeems to expreſs a certain property of its Nature; for ſince it is ſeen to conſiſt of a certain ſtreiked Matter, and of it may eaſily be made Glaſs endued with various Colours, which proceed there from we have called it <hi>Spies-glaſs,</hi> as if we ſhould ſay ſtreiked Glaſs. From which Variety of the Name, by a prudent Judgment, a
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62975:28"/>ſingular Collection may be made, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Antimony</hi> was known, and greatly eſteemed, and its virtue and Utility obſerved and brought into uſe by the <hi>Arabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Chaldeans, Latins,</hi> and our <hi>Germans:</hi> but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the Hereſies of various Opinions ariſing, the uſe was vitiated, and its Virtue and Glory firſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured, and afterward wholly extinguiſhed. Of which there is no Reaſon to Doubt; for nothing is more probable, than that Truth ſhould ſuffer Dammage and Shipwrack by the Oppreſſion of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies. For who knows not the Malice of the Devil, which by Reaſon of our Sins and Blindneſs is very often permitted by <hi>GOD.</hi> The Devil is the perpetual Enemy of Mankind, who imploys all his Strength, and all his Deceits, and omits no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, which in himſelf is, to prevent the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the profit of true Medecine, and to exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate its uſe; knowing well enough, that by that means the power and glory of <hi>GOD</hi> is obſcured, and thoſe Sacrifices of the praiſes of men are impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, by which they gave thanks to <hi>GOD,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath inſited as it were the Rayes of his Goodneſs in the Creatures, whence they may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Health by a natural auxiliary.</p>
            <p>But ſince to diſcourſe of the Name of <hi>Antimony,</hi> is not to our purpoſe, we will deſiſt from this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For all the Praiſe of <hi>Antimony</hi> conſiſts in the Preparation thereof, which is made for perfecting the Virtues infuſed in it from Nature by the <hi>Author</hi> of <hi>Nature.</hi> Therefore my diſcourſe ſhall be of this, handling it and its known Virtue, and I will endeavour to make my Name immortal. Yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I come to declare the Virtue of <hi>Antimony,</hi> ſince I above confeſſed, that it is meer Venom, I would have you know and diligently note, that Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom is able to draw Venom to it ſelf, becauſe like it ſelf, much ſooner and much more than any other Thing of another Nature.</p>
            <pb n="37" facs="tcp:62975:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>Now let any Reader conſider, and obſerve it as a Thing worthy of Note, that the true <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicorns-horn,</hi> ſophiſticated by no fallacy, repels all Venom from it ſelf, nor can it aſſume or draw to it ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing of Venom, as is manifeſt by Experience. Let a living Spider be put in a Circle made of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corns-horn,</hi> and out of this Circle it cannot go, or paſs over the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicorns-horn,</hi> for it ſhuns what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is adverſe to Venom. But if the Circle be made of venemous Matter, it is not to be doubted, but that the Spider will go out of it, and paſs over that Venom like it ſelf. Note this Experiment, make a piece of Silver hollow, and put it in Water, that it may float like a Boat, and put Venom to it, then hold a piece of true Unicorns-Horn, as nigh to it as you can, but ſo as you may not touch it, that Unicorns-Horn by its ſpiritual Virtue will drive the Silver from it, ſo that it will flie away like a Duck, which ſwimming on the Water flies, when it perceives the Snares of the Fowler ready to entangle it. But on the contrary, Nature in a wonderful manner loves and follows its own like, as appears by this Example. Put a little piece of pure and fine Bread in a diſh full of Water, ſo as the Bread may ſwim upon the Water, hold a piece of true Unicorns-Horn cloſe to it, yet ſo as it touch it not; and if you leiſurely move the Unicorns-Horn the little piece of Bread will follow it. Nature ſo much loves its own like, and ſo much hates what is unlike it ſelf, as this flies, and that follows. Therefore let our <hi>Doctors</hi> conſider, that Venom by a certain Magnetick Power Attracts Venom, and thoſe things which are void of Venom, do in like manner draw to themſelves things pure, and want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Venomous quality.</p>
            <p>Therefore Venom may be taken away two ways; firſt, by its Contrary, which reſiſts Venom, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62975:29"/>is related of the Unicorns-Horn. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by Like, when Venom by a certain Magnetick power draws Venom to it ſelf. But the Venom which muſt heal Venom like it ſelf, ought firſt to be ſo prepared, as its Venom may paſs into Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, and by its own attractive virtue, aſſume the other to and expel it with it ſelf. Of which thing you have a moſt clear Example in <hi>Soap:</hi> That is compounded of Oyl and other fat ingredient Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which ſeem to be, and in very deed are, more apt to foul, than cleanſe Linen; but becauſe in the Boyling of the Soap, eſpecially by the help of Salt, a certain Separation and Preparation is made, the Soap is rendred moſt apt to draw to it ſelf and waſh out all foulneſs and filths from Linen and other things: ſo indeed may Venom in a certain manner, by Antecedent Preparation be accommodated ſo, as to be no more Venom, but a Medicament, it draws to it ſelf all other Poyſon, caſts it out, and reſtores the man to his priſtine Purity and Health.</p>
            <p>Now ſince our Diſcourſe hath led us ſo far, and we have begun to open Nature ſo much; that the truly Studious of Medicine (though hitherto igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of this) may clearly know, what Good or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil is latent in Nature, what is Venom and what is harmleſs; which is a thing hath not as yet been found out by Doctors, by reaſon of their own ſupine negligence; and that the Truth thereof may be demonſtrated and alſo confirmed, it will not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs to produce certain Experimental Examples, which may diſcover the Truth, and refute the falſe Opinions of others. Put an Egg, which in the Winter is congealed with Cold, into very cold Water, there let it lie for a due ſpace of time, and the Ice will externally adhere to the Egg-ſhell, but the Cold be extracted from the Egg it ſelf, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to its priſtine vigour and intireneſs. Again,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62975:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>if any Member be benummed with Cold, let not the Patient neglect himſelf, but apply cold Snow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water round about, ſo one Cold attracts the other, and the Member is reſtored. On the contrary, if any One have a Member inflamed, let him apply to that Inflammation an hot Matter; as for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, Spirit of Wine, which is mere Fire, or the Quinteſſence of Sulphur, and he will in very deed find, that Heat is attracted by Heat, in a certain Magnetick manner, and like to rejoyce in like, and not only to aſſwage the pain and heat of the inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Member, but abſolutely to reſtore the ſame to its priſtine ſtrength.</p>
            <p>Yet leſt this our purpoſe ſhould not be fully e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough confirmed by Examples, I will alſo add an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, by way of Supplement. Take Frog-Spawn in the Moneth of <hi>March,</hi> and laying it on a Board dry it in the Sun, when dry reduce it to Powder, and ſtrew of this Powder, upon Wounds made by Venomous Vipers or Serpents; by this means ſuch Wounds will be ſo prepared, as they may be perfectly healed by other Medicaments applied thereunto. Or otherwiſe, if Linen cloaths be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten moiſtned in Frog-Spawn, and as often dried, and that Linen cut into ſmall pieces and applied to Wounds, they effect the ſame, as the aforeſaid Powder would have done. But that the very foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of this Truth may more clearly be declared; take a venomous Toad, dry him in the Sun, ſhut him up in an Earthen cloſed Pot, and by burning reduce him to Aſhes; then having taken out the Aſhes, and reduced the ſame to Powder, apply of that Powder to a Wound made by Venom, and this Poyſon attracts the other Poyſon, and joyns it with it ſelf. Why ſo, I pray? Becauſe by this Burning, which is the Calcination of the Toad, its interior Virtue is made manifeſt, and efficacious for opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:62975:30"/>ſo, that Like can attract like, and eſpecially Venom Venom, to it ſelf. Therefore firmly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade your ſelf, that this Truth is infallible and immutable, which I have here propoſed to you and others by Example. If any One afflicted with the Peſt, do diligently obſerve this, he will find the Truth of thoſe Things I have here above mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: the <hi>Aſtrum</hi> of <hi>Sol,</hi> and the Spirit of <hi>Mercury,</hi> miniſtred in a Peſtilential Seaſon, preſerve many. For the Spirit of <hi>Mercury</hi> doth alſo draw to it ſelf its own like, and hath in it ſelf the Medicament, and attractive power of all venomous Diſeaſes. Yet ſince the <hi>Aſtrum</hi> of <hi>Sol,</hi> from which (as from an operative and all vivifying Sun) all things in their kinds univerſally ariſe; therefore I deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine that in the potency of Gold, more than in all other Things, is an Operating Nature; that is, in its own <hi>Aſtrum,</hi> whence both it ſelf, and all Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals and Minerals, in the Beginning, received their firſt Nativity and Propagation of Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Touching which more may be ſaid, when I ſhall manifeſt to you the <hi>Aſtrum</hi> of <hi>Sol,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the ſame moſt religiouſly to your Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>After the ſame manner proceſs is to be made with <hi>Antimony,</hi> which hath the ſame Operations with corporal Gold; yet of the <hi>Aſtrum</hi> thereof I now ſpeak not. For I know (ſaith <hi>Antimony</hi>) it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves me, before that, to fear and tremble; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in many principal <hi>Arcanums</hi> of Medicine, I far excel it; yet univerſally I am able to effect none of thoſe Things, which the <hi>Aſtrum</hi> of <hi>Sol</hi> (confirmed by the Teſtimony of Celeſtial Verity) is able to produce. The <hi>Aſtrum</hi> of <hi>Mercury</hi> I omit, becauſe I my ſelf have my deſcent from the ſame Original with it: but as to a Celeſtial pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating power of Operating, I give the firſt place
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:62975:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>of Dominion to the <hi>Aſtrum</hi> of <hi>Sol.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>So here alſo underſtand, that <hi>Antimony</hi> ought in a certain Method ſo to be handled, as its <hi>Mercury</hi> may be ſeparated from the Sulphur thereof, in a Natural Manner. Now, as Fire, which lies ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſconded in Matter, unleſs it be made manifeſt, and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62975:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>can be demonſtrated, is profitable for nothing, is not (as I may ſay) tangible by the Hands, nor can it effect any thing to purpoſe; ſo Medicine can effect nothing that is excellent, unleſs it be firſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from its Groſsneſs, rectified and ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged of Impurities, clarified and brought to Light by due Preparation, as is manifeſt in all Things: for when Separation of the pure from the impure is made, and all that is mountanous or terreſtrial is ſegregated from the pure Metal, then the deſired Harveſt is to be expected. Hence it is manifeſt, that Fire can effect nothing, before it is in a certain manner opened and ſet at Liberty, that it may operate. Therefore, to comprehend much in few Words, I ſay, this is the Condition of <hi>Antimony.</hi> Whatſoever is occult and abſconded from the Knowledge of the Vulgar, that in joys the Name and Honour of Art, <hi>viz.</hi> as long as it lies hid; but ſo ſoon as it is diſcovered and made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, Art hath end, and it becomes a Mechanick Work; as I have more than once declared in other of my Books.</p>
            <p>A Bee ſucks Honey from Flowers, with ſuch Art as the Almighty hath inſited in it, in which Honey is latent a Virtue, Juice, and Corroborative Power, of which a Medicine is made, as is obvious to the Eyes of all Men. Now, from that <hi>Honey,</hi> of a ſweet and moſt pleaſant Taſte, a violent Corroſive and preſent Venom may be prepared; which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps no man, unleſs he who hath learned it, will believe; no man certainly conſiders this, unleſs he be a diligent Obſerver. Yet for this Cauſe Honey is not to be contemned, nor is it to be ſaid, that although it hath a moſt grateful Sweetneſs, yet it is a Corrupt Medicine; becauſe a Corroſive may be made of it: but it ſhould rather be ſaid, that Corruption proceeds from the Phyſicians igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62975:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>who knew not how duely to prepare it. Here I am willing to teach the ignorant Phyſician, to free him from the laſt Judgment. For Honey is prepared of the Superfluities of Brute Animals, by which the Grounds and Fields are fatned; in thoſe Grounds ariſe Flowers, Herbs, Fruit-Trees of various kinds, from which the Bees ſuck a moſt noble Quinteſſence: by this is made the Alteration and Generation of one Thing into another, <hi>viz.</hi> into Aliment of another Form and Taſte, which in no wiſe agrees with the former, and that is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Honey. Of ſuch Honey is prepared a Food moſt grateful, pleaſant and fit for man, and for many Things moſt profitable. Of the ſame may be prepared a Poyſon moſt hurtful to Man and Beaſt.</p>

For of <hi>Antimony,</hi> if its Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom be firſt changed into Remedy, is made a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, which eradicates, and like Fire penetrates, prepares and by cocting conſumes all Diſeaſes. Wherefore <hi>Antimony</hi> is firſt to be prepared into a true <hi>Stone,</hi> which is the Quinteſſence thereof; and becauſe, in its Operation it is altogether like unto Fire, (when reduced to its Coagulation) it ſhall by me be named the <hi>Stone</hi> of <hi>Fire.</hi> When this <hi>Stone</hi> of <hi>Fire</hi> is rightly prepared, as in the End of this Treatiſe I will further ſhew, its Medicinal Virtue conſumes all noxious Humours, purifies the Blood in the higheſt Degree, and performs all that may be effected by <hi>Aurum potabile.</hi>

            <p>Therefore, I pray you, my unexperienced Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, who have neither learned my Preparation, nor conceived the Uſe, not to judge from a falſe Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and your own ignorant Thoughts; but ſet about the Work it ſelf, and learn how the Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Antimony</hi> ought to be made, how you ſhould further proceed with it, how its Venom is expelled and ſeparated, and Salutary Medicine poſited in the place of it, and exalted. When I ſay<note n="*" place="margin">Here again the <hi>Author</hi> waxeth hot againſt falſe Phyſicians; but do you read on, and after this Heat he will give you a profitable Doctrine, which you may ſoon find in <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Wine.</hi>
               </note> you ſhall have performed This, then at length will you be able to judge of the difference, and underſtand thoſe things, which before were very far remote from your Knowledge.</p>
            <p>O you wretched and to be pitied <hi>Medicaſters,</hi> who painted with a <hi>Fucus,</hi> breath out I know not what <hi>Thraſonick</hi> Brags, and paſs over Mountains wanting Foundation, walking through Clouds in your own Thoughts, and know not where at length you ſhall reſt your Foot: you, I ſay, I admoniſh to conſider what you will anſwer, in the Extream Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Son of <hi>GOD. Seek,</hi> and when you have found, convert what you find to uſe, and ſo performing your Office commit the Reſt to <hi>GOD,</hi> who will give ſucceſs, and never leave you deſtitute of help. But you infamous men, more mad than <hi>Bacchanalian</hi> Fools, who will neither learn, nor foul your Hands with Coals, judge not leſt you procure Judgment to be pronounced againſt you, which your Childrens Children may write down to your ſhame in an undeleble Character.</p>
            <p>Every Phyſician ought above all Things to take Care, that he do neither leſs nor more, than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:62975:32"/>the Reſtitution of Health loſt, not inſtituting his Curation contrary to Nature, or deviating from her direct Intention. When Spirit of Wine is poured upon <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> a vehement Ebullition is made, and theſe two Natures will not eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelves to be together; but he, that knows how by Diſtillation to conjoyn and unite them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the true Intention of Philoſophers, he may uſe them in many things for good. After the ſame manner, Oyl or Liquor of Tartar, and Vinegar made of Rich Wine, act each upon other; for they hate and fly from each other, as Fire and Water, although they proceeded from one and the ſame Matter. Therefore the Phyſician ought in a ſpecial manner to be mindful, to underſtand all Circumſtances from the Sick very exactly, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fider the ſame being underſtood that in Curing he may uſe ſuch Means, as are fit to remove the Diſeaſe, leſt the Patient be injured by the Medicine. As for Example, when Iron is diſſolved in <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> if you ſuddainly pour Oyl of Tartar upon that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, you ſhall difficultly preſerve the Glaſs from breaking; for the contrary Natures, like unto Gun-powder, take Fire, and break the Glaſs. Of all theſe Things, our Gown Doctors know nothing at all; therefore they have no other Defence for their Ignorance, than Silence only.</p>
            <p>You titular Doctors, you I ſpeak to, who write long Scroles of Receipts: you Apothecaries, who with your Decoctions fill Pots, no leſs than Thoſe (in Princes Courts) in which Meat is boyled for the ſuſtentation of ſome hundreds of men: you, I ſay, who hitherto have been blind, ſuffer a <hi>Collyrium</hi> to be poured into your Eyes, and permit them to be anointed with Balſom, that the moſt thick skin of Blindneſs may fall from your Sight, and you behold the Truth, as in a moſt clear Glaſs. <hi>GOD</hi> grant
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:62975:33"/>you Grace, that you may know his wonderful Works, and the Love of your Neighbour be root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in you, that you may ſearch out true Medicine, which the Ruler of the Heavens hath, by his own omnipotent hand, and his ineffable and eternal Wiſdom, from above infuſed in, impreſſed on, and communicated to his Noble Creatures, for the Good of Mankind; whence man may find help in his greateſt Neceſſity, and Counſel for Health in his Diſeaſes. Why do you, miſerable Worm of the Earth, and food of Worms, look ſo intently on the Rind or Shell, and neglect the Kernel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unmindful of your <hi>Creator,</hi> who formed you according to his Image; when as you ought to give thanks to him, and with diligent Study to ſearch out his Works, exceeding Nature her ſelf? Return and look into your ſelf, there behold the Image of your own Ingratitude, that you may be aſhamed of your ſelf, eſpecially becauſe you have not ſearched out thoſe Things, which the moſt wiſe <hi>GOD,</hi> for the Good of Mortals; hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed in his Creatures; by knowing which, you might have offered unto him the moſt acceptable Sacrifice of Praiſe and Gratitude.</p>
            <p>But I will put an end to this Diſcourſe, leſt my Tears (which I can ſcarcely keep in, from continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally falling from mine Eyes) ſhould blot this my Writing, and whilſt I deplore the Blindneſs of the World, I blemiſh this Lamentation, which I would have known to all men. I am a man Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, incorporated in a moſt holy Order, in which I will perſevere, as long as it ſhall pleaſe the Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent <hi>GOD,</hi> to animate this miſerable Body with Vital Spirit: therefore I muſt not write o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, or otherwiſe, than is agreeable to this State. But had I the Office of a Secular Judge, I would lift up my Voyce, and found a Trumpet in
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:62975:33"/>their Ears, that thoſe deaf men may hear, who hitherto would not acknowledge the Truth, but out of Ignorance, without Cauſe, falſly and ſlande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly perſecute, calumniate, contemn, diſparage, and meditate how they may totally ſuppreſs the ſame.</p>
            <p>But thou, O Lord <hi>GOD,</hi> who dwelleſt in the Higheſt, who art called and truly art the <hi>GOD</hi> of Reſt, who ſitting in the Supreme Throne of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, governeſt Heaven and Earth, which thou haſt created, who conſerveſt the Stars, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daineſt the Courſe of the Firmament in its Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on according to thy Command, before whom all Creatures tremble, which are found in the Earth, or in Heaven, and the Infernal Spirits are aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with unexpreſſable dread, be pleaſed, I pray to look down upon the Tranſactions of this moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful World, and teach them inwardly to know thoſe Things, which thou haſt outwardly and viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly propoſed to the Sons of Men, that thou mayeſt be prayſed in thy Throne, known in thy Verity, and adored in thy immenſe Majeſty. As for my ſelf, I an unworthy and miſerable man, give thanks unto thee, for thy great and infinite Gifts and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of Riches and Health beſtowed on me, and laud thy Majeſty for ever for the ſame. More, O my Father and Lord, I neither can, nor am able to deſire in this periſhing World.</p>
            <p>Now, that we may write of <hi>Antimony,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin our Diſcourſe from the very Foundation, whence <hi>Antimony</hi> acquires its Empire, Triumph and Glory, by which it is exalted to perfect Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we muſt before all Things diſcover the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Original of its Root: how it is generated in the Earth, to the Dominion of what Stars it is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, and what Elements have throughly dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted it, and which they be, that have brought it to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62975:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>Maturity. <hi>Antimony</hi> is no other than a Fume, or (as I may otherwiſe call it) a Mineral Vapour, which is genited from above by the Stars, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward by the Elements deduced and digeſted to formal Coagulation and Maturity. Here it is to be noted, that <hi>Antimony</hi> hath acquired its Eſſence, Virtue, Power, Operation and Quality, from the ſame Principle, Root and Eſſence, whence Vulgar Mercury is produced; yet with more firm Coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, ſo that it is brought to an harder Eſſence, than the living or running Mercury of the Vulgar hath. The Reaſon of this is, becauſe it hath aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med from the three Principles, a little more of the Subſtance of Salt, than Common Mercury. For although of all the three Principles, it hath the leaſt part of Salt, yet it hath aſſumed more of the Eſſence of Salt, than common Mercury, whence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it hath hapned ſuch a Coagulation. Hardneſs in every thing is from Salt, which vulgar Mercury hath not. For it hath a very ſmall part of Salt, but in it, in a ſpiritual manner, is inſited a certain more hot <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Sulphur;</hi> therefore it alwayes flows, and cannot be brought to Coagulation, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs by the help of other Metallick Spirits, which endued with very great Virtues, are chiefly found in the <hi>Matrix</hi> of <hi>Saturn,</hi> without which it cannot be fixed, unleſs by him, who poſſeſſeth the <hi>Stone</hi> of <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> by which its three Principles may be brought to a concordant Equality, and then it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires ſuch a Body, as will melt, flow, and abide the Hammer, like all other Metals: otherwiſe Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is and will be fluid Mercury, until its volatility be this way taken away. Hence it is known, that all Animals and all Vegetables are too weak to fix Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury into a malleable Subſtance (as many have in vain endeavoured) becauſe all theſe have not a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallick Nature. <hi>Mercury,</hi> within and without, is
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62975:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>no other than meer Fire; therefore it is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtible by any Fire, no Fire can apprehend it ſo, as to alter its Eſſence, but it ſuddenly ſlies and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves it ſelf into an incombuſtible Oyl Spiritually; or after its fixation it remains ſo invariable, as no ſtrength or power of men is ſufficient again to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it. And whatſoever can now be made of Gold may then alſo be made of it by Art; becauſe after Coagulation it is altogether like Gold: for it with Gold hath one and the ſame Root, Stock, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction originally.</p>
            <p>But ſince I purpoſe not in this place to diſcourſe more largely of <hi>Mercury,</hi> and intend only ſimply (yet truly) to deſcribe the very Foundation of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony,</hi> from true and certain Principles, I will ceaſe to ſpeak of <hi>Mercury,</hi> and proceed to a further De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of <hi>Antimony.</hi> Yet, whatſoever I have propoſed by way of Similitude touching <hi>Mercury</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Which ſo miſerably perplexeth all the Students of this Art: what our <hi>Mercury</hi> is, which is the <hi>Matter</hi> of the <hi>Stone,</hi> which is found every where and in all Things, is here briefly and clearly manif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Wherefore moſt diligently think on this; often bear in mind, obſerve and underſtand, that all Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals and Metals together, in the ſame Time, and after the ſame manner, and of one and the ſame principal Matter, are produced and genited. That Matter is no other, than a meer Vapour,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:62975:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>which is extracted from the Elementary <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>arth by the Superior <hi>Stars,</hi> as by a Sydereal Diſtillation of the Macrocoſm: which Sydereal hot Infuſion, with an Airy-Sulphureous Property deſcending upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriors, ſo acts and operates, as in thoſe Metals and Minerals is implanted ſpiritually and inviſibly a certain Power and Virtue, which Fume afterward reſolves it ſelf in the Earth, into a certain Water, from which Mineral Water all Metals are thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth generated and ripened to their Perfection; and thence proceeds this or that Metal or Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, according as one of the three Principles a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires Dominion, and they have much or little of Sulphur and Salt, or an unequal Mixture of the weight of them, whence ſome Metals are fixed; that is, ſome conſtant and ſtable, ſome volatile and eaſily mutable, as is ſeen in <hi>Gold, Silver, Copper, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>But Gold, in its <hi>Aſtrum</hi> and Beginning was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibed with a much more perfect <hi>Sulphur,</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> much more perfect <hi>Mercury,</hi> than all other Meta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> and Minerals, and therefore its operative Virtue is much more potent and more efficacious, than the <hi>Aſtrums</hi> of other Metals: Yea, all Virtues whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever are diſperſed in other Metals, and many more than them, are found in the <hi>Aſtrum</hi> of Gold only. Moreover I ſay, when that one thing is brought to further Maturity by Fire, it contains more Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than all Metals and Minerals together. There is one only Mineral, of which I have often made mention already, in which is found a Sulphur of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62975:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Sol,</hi> equally as ſtrong and powerful, yea more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and more ſtrong, than in Gold it ſelf: ſo alſo, there are two kinds of Metals found, in which this Predominancy powerfully Triumphs, of which at this time I have neither will nor diſpoſition to write; but I am willing to keep within the Bounds I have ſet my ſelf in treating of the Eſſence of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony,</hi> touching which I purpoſe now to ſpeak.</p>
            <p>Therefore <hi>Antimony</hi> is a Mineral made of the Vapour of the Earth changed into Water, which Spiritual Syderal Tranſmutation is the true <hi>Aſtrum</hi> of <hi>Antimony;</hi> which Water, by the Stars firſt, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward by the Element of Fire, which reſides in the Element of Air, is extracted from the Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Earth, and by Coagulation formally changed into a tangible Eſſence, in which tangible Eſſence, (<hi>viz.</hi> whence <hi>Antimony</hi> is formally made) is found very much of <hi>Sulphur</hi> predominant, of <hi>Mercury</hi> not ſo much, and of <hi>Salt</hi> the leaſt of all three; yet it aſſumes ſo much <hi>Salt,</hi> as it thence acquires an hard and immalleable Maſs. The principal Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of it is dry and hot, or rather burning, of Cold and Humidity it hath very little in it, as there is in Common Mercury; in Corporal Gold alſo is more Heat than Cold. Theſe may ſuffice to be ſpoken of the Matter, and three Fundamental Principles of <hi>Antimony,</hi> how by the <hi>Archeus</hi> in the Element of Earth it is brought to perfection.</p>
            <p>Yet the Lovers of <hi>Chymiſtry</hi> ſhould not think this Philoſophick Reaſon by me alleadged of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity to them, nor need they be ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous to know, in what Center the <hi>Aſtrum</hi> of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> reſts, or from what Root it ſlows; but ſhould rather deſire to learn the Utility and uſe thereof; <hi>viz.</hi> which way it ought to be prepared and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to its State, that they may know its Virtue, Power, and Operation, touching which in times
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62975:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>paſt ſo many Things have been written, and to this Day are mentioned, and ſpoken of by all men of all States and Conditions. For the Learned, as well as the Unlearned hope to have their ardent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiable Deſire ſatisfied by This; therefore I will not detain the Reader with ambiguous Diſcourſes, or tedious Delays, but ſimply teach every Thing, which I by great Study and Diligence (which I have often imployed about <hi>Antimony</hi>) could find out touching the Eſſence of <hi>Antimony.</hi> For no man, by reaſon of the ſhortneſs of Life, can know or ſearch out all its <hi>Arcanum</hi>'s: becauſe in Preparation of <hi>Antimony,</hi> one new Wonder follows another perpetually; one Degree ſucceeds a former De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, Colour follows Colour, and one Virtue, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or Operation always manifeſts it ſelf greater than another.</p>
            <p>And, to begin here I ſay, <hi>Antimony</hi> is meer Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom, not of the kind of the leaſt Venoms, but ſuch, as by which you may deſtroy Men and Beaſts, ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomous a power is diffuſed through the whole Subſtance of this Mineral. Hence ariſeth the common Exclamation of all men. For the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, unskilful Doctors, and all Thoſe, to whom the ground of true Medicine is unknown, do with one mouth proclaim it <hi>Venom, Venom!</hi> Poyſon, ſay they (as I my ſelf above confeſſed) lies in <hi>Antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</hi> For this Cauſe let us diſſwade all men from its uſe; for it endangers the Health and Life. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Doctors</hi> reſident in Princes Courts, admoniſh Monarchs, Princes, and other Potentates not to uſe <hi>Antimony.</hi> Other Scholaſticks cry out, Beware, you in no wiſe admit <hi>Antimony</hi> into Medicinal Uſe; for it's meer Poyſon: theſe the Inhabitants of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Villages follow. And this far ſpread Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour ſo moves the greateſt part of Mortals, as <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory</hi> in theſe our Days is very ill ſpoken of, and no
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:62975:36"/>man dares put confidence in the Medicine thereof, which in it is found ſo various and unexpreſſible. For truly and holily I affirm (as truly as <hi>GOD</hi> is the Creator of all things viſible, which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in Heaven or Earth, which either have come, or in time to come ſhall come unto our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) that under Heaven, or by the Rays of the Sun, with the Guidance of Experience, can be found or demonſtrated no greater Medicine, than is in this Mineral; yea, there is no Subject, in which ſo fluently and abundantly can be found ſuch moſt certain Remedies for Health, as ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared (by ſure and undeniable Experiments) to be in <hi>Antimony.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Son, attend to this my Diſcourſe, and do thou Reader give heed to my Writings, and do you wiſe men of the World diligently obſerve my Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Antimony</hi> founded on Experience. For my <hi>Theory</hi> ariſeth from Nature, and my <hi>Practice</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from certain Experience, which ſhews its manifold Utility, and infinite Ways produceth the ſame, not without the incredible Admiration of all men. But I aſſent to you, and confeſs (as I have before acknowledged in my Writings) that <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> at firſt is meer Venom, and before Preparation hath nothing in or with it ſelf, but Poyſon; and that I affirm to be true. But you, whoſoever you are, inſignized or not inſignized with the Degree of <hi>Doctor, Maſter,</hi> or <hi>Batcheler,</hi> whether skilful in Art, or by ſome other Priviledge promoted; you, I ſay, who ſo inconſiderately and ſo arrogantly without Truth exclaim, and prate againſt me, pauſe a while, and forget not your own Argument, hear what I have here to ſay. <hi>Antimony</hi> is Venom, therefore every One muſt beware he uſe it not. No, that doth not follow Mr. <hi>Doctor, Batchelor,</hi> or <hi>Maſter;</hi> it doth not follow, I ſay, Mr. <hi>Doctor,</hi>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:62975:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>although you be proud of your Red Hat. <hi>Treacle</hi> is made of the moſt perillous Venom of a <hi>Viper,</hi> which is called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, whence alſo it had its Name; therefore no man muſt uſe it, for there is poyſon in it. Doth this Conſequence pleaſe you? How doth this my Doctrine like you? You hear, that after Preparation, no Venenoſity is found in <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony;</hi> for by the Spagyrick Art <hi>Antimony</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted from Venom into Medicine, no otherwiſe than as of the Venom of a Viper is ſaid, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into <hi>Treacle;</hi> but without Preparation you ſhall find no Good in it, nor any thing of Medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Help, but much loſs and detriment.</p>
            <p>Now, whoſoever deſires to become a Diſciple of <hi>Antimony,</hi> he muſt, after Prayer, and an carreſt Invocation of <hi>GOD,</hi> betake himſelf to the School of <hi>Vulcan;</hi> for he is the Maſter and Revealer of all Secrets. This Maſter is contemned by the Wiſe Men of the World, ſet very light by and derided; becauſe they, by reaſon of their own Negligence and Malignity, have learned nothing of him; and all Revelation, through their own Sloath, is impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: for no Medicine was eyer prepared without <hi>Vulcan,</hi> whatſoever thoſe ſenſleſs mad men ſhall bable and affirm to the Contrary.</p>
            <p>But I will proceed to the Proceſs and Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Antimony;</hi> for I little value the Clamours of arrogant and ſelf applauding men: let them make and bring to light any Work that can excel <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</hi> It is well known to me, that of <hi>Antimony</hi> may be made Medicines equal to Thoſe, which are in Gold and vulgar Mercury (I except the <hi>Aſtrum</hi> of <hi>Sol</hi>) for of this may be prepared <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> againſt the Leproſie, of this may be made Spirit of Mercury, the higheſt Remedy againſt the French <hi>POX,</hi> of this other infinite Remedies may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared. If thoſe Contemners cannot perceive and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:62975:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>underſtand this, what wonder is it? None, becauſe they have not learned it. No man can give a ſound Judgment of that, which he never learned. Let the Aſs, an <hi>Animal</hi> like them in ſtupidity be their Example, who cannot teach a Shepherd how to handle his Pipe, ſo as to play an Harmonious Tune; becauſe he hath not learned. So, right Judgement, with a ſolid Foundation cannot be given by a man, who before hath not bent his Studies that way, that from Writings he may be able to diſcern what, in ſuch a Buſineſs, is juſt or unjuſt. After the ſame manner in this Faculty, what can be attributed to any of the <hi>Doctors,</hi> before he hath from Writings, and by his own proper labour ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired Knowledge?</p>
            <p>Yet before I paſs to the Proceſs it ſelf, ſome One may perhaps interrupt and ask me, which way both Minerals and other Things receive their Venonoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? What Venom is? Whence the Poyſon of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Thing hath its Original? How it may be taken away, alſo how ſuch a Mineral may without peril ſecurely be uſed for Health after evacuation of that Venom? To theſe Queſtions I will briefly and clearly anſwer. The Infuſion of Venom falls un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a twofold Conſideration, <hi>viz.</hi> Natural and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural.</p>
            <p>The firſt Reaſon, why <hi>GOD</hi> the ſupreme Lord of the Stars, and the Maker of Heaven and Earth, hath propoſed to us open Venom, eſpecially in Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, is, that by this his Ordination he might ſhew to us his Wonders and powerful Works, for diſtinction of Good and Evil, as in the Law he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to us the Knowledge of That, which lies as a Duty on us to do, <hi>viz.</hi> to Chooſe the Good and Eſchew the Evil. So alſo the Tree of Life in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe was propoſed; its right uſe tended to Good, but its abuſe brought the Fall to Evil; for by
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:62975:38"/>that <hi>GOD</hi>'s Command was broke, whence proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Deſtruction and all Evil. This is the firſt Reaſon.</p>
            <p>A Second Reaſon is, that by this we might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend and underſtand the Diſtinction between Evil and Good, and at length learn to exterminate Malice and repoſit Goodneſs in its place. For <hi>GOD</hi> wills not, that man ſhould periſh and be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, but that he ſhould depart from Evil, and come to amendment of Life, that Deſtruction may be driven far away from his Soul. So, to Us his Creatures, with wonderful Conveniency hath he propoſed Good and Evll, which is found both in the Precept of the Word, and in the Work of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; that we may chooſe what is profitable and good for Health, and ſhun what is evil and pernitions.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Venom is alſo made by the Stars, when contrary Oppoſitions and Conjunctions of them happen, by which the Elements are Infected ſo, as they become the Cauſe of Peſtilences, and other Venomous Diſeaſes in this World: which alſo is to be underſtood of <hi>Comets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, Venom is made from Things repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant each to other, as when any One inkindles a deadly Poyſon in himſelf, by Anger or Sadneſs; alſo when a man drinks being above meaſure hot.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, among Venoms may be numbred Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, with which any One is ſlain; then the Abuſe of Arms is Venom to that man. But when any One uſeth Arms, for the juſt and unblamable deſence of his Body, to which end they were invented, then they may be accounted a certain kind of Medicine.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, the Cauſe of Venom may be demonſtrated by Nature, in this manner: whatſoever Nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſts is Venom, and that becauſe it ſights againſt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. As when any one eats ſuch Food, as his <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach</hi> cannot bear, then that Food is Venom to him; for it is repugnant to Nature: on the contrary,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:62975:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>if any One eat ſuch Food, as is Friendly to his Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, to him that Food is Medicine.</p>
            <p>But Venom is principally attracted to Bodies in the Earth, whilſt they are a certain Mercurial Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence (now I ſpeak of the Venom of Minerals) which yet is in an immature, crude, and not well digeſted Form, which is repugnant to Nature, and difficultly digeſted; becauſe ſuch a Mercurial Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is not yet perfect, well digeſted to Maturity, therefore it paſſeth through the whole Body, as a crude, immature, undigeſtible Mineral. As if crude Corn ſhould be eaten by men, that would be ſo difficult to be digeſted by the Stomach, as a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble debility of the Body would follow. For the natural Heat is too weak to deduce that to a due Concoction and Perfection. Corn, which receives its Maturity from the Fire of the Great World, muſt afterward be throughly cocted by the Minor Fire, that it may be digeſted by the Microcoſm. As before we ſaid, touching the boyling of Fleſh to Maturity; ſo here the ſame is to be underſtood of <hi>Antimony,</hi> which being yet crude, and not throughly cocted in the Earth to fixedneſs, the Stomach of Man (as I may ſo ſpeak) is too weak to bear it, or retain the ſame, as by certain Experience is manifeſted, <hi>viz.</hi> that all <hi>Catharticks,</hi> whether Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, Animals or Vegetables, are venomous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of a certain Mercurial volatile Matter ſtill predominant in them; which volatile Spirit is the Cauſe why other things, which are in man, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled: not that by this Means the Root it ſelf of Diſeaſes is laid hold on, which only is eſſected by the fixedneſs of every Medicine. For every Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine throughly fixed, ſearcheth out fixed Diſeaſes, and eradicates them; which Purgers not fixed can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do, but they do only as it were carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſome Spoyl from Diſeaſes; or they may be
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:62975:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>compared to Water, which driven by force through a Street Penetrates not the Earth it ſelf. Fixed Remedies purge not by the Inferior Parts, becauſe that is not the familiar way of Expelling fixed Venoms, and that way they would not touch the Kernel (as I may call it) or Center of the Diſeaſe; but by expelling Sweat, and otherways they ſtrike at the very inmoſt Root of the Diſeaſe, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with a certain ſuperficial Expulſion of Filths. Therefore we often admoniſh all and every One, that all venomous Impurity is totally to be taken away from <hi>Antimony,</hi> before it can either be, or be called ſuch a Medicine, as may ſafely be given. For this Cauſe, the Good muſt be ſeparated from the Evil, the Fixed from the not fixed, and the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine from the Venom with accurate diligence, if we hope by the Uſe of <hi>Antimony</hi> to obtain true Honour, and true Utility; but Fire only can ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect that. For <hi>Vulcan</hi> is the ſole and only Maſter of all Theſe. Whatſoever the <hi>Vulcan</hi> in the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Orbe leaves crude and perfects not, that in the Leſſer World muſt be amended by a certain other <hi>Vulcan,</hi> ripning the Immature, and cocting the Crude by Heat, and ſeparating the Pure from the Impure. That this is poſſible no man doubts; for dayly Experience teacheth the ſame, and it is very apparent in the Corporal Aſpect of Colours, which proceed from the Fire. For by Separation and Fire, which perfect Fixation, Venenoſity is taken away, and a Change is made of the Evil into Good, as we have already ſaid. Therefore Fire is the Separator of Venom from Medicine, and of Good from Evil; which is a thing, that None of the <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians</hi> either dares or can truly and fundamentally own, or demonſtrate to me, unleſs he who hath firmly contracted Friendſhip with <hi>Vulcan,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted the ſiry Bath full of Love, by which the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:62975:39"/>Spouſe, being throughly purged from all Defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, may legitimately lie down with her Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom in the Marriage Bed.</p>
            <p>Fie upon the Acuteneſs of the Worldly Wit of thoſe, who neither underſtand, nor are willing to endeavour to underſtand theſe my Writings. If you did know, what is called fixed, and what not fixed, and what it ſignifies to ſeparate the Pure from the Impure, aſſuredly you would purpoſely forget many Things, and omitting other vain Works, would follow me only. For in me (<hi>Antimony</hi> ſpeaks of himſelf) you will find <hi>Mercury, Sulphur</hi> and <hi>Salt,</hi> then which Nothing is more Conducible for the Health of men. <hi>Mercury</hi> is in the <hi>Regulus, Sulphur</hi> in the Red Colour, and <hi>Salt</hi> in the remaining black Earth. He that can ſeparate theſe, and again unite them in a due manner, according to Art, ſo as Fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation may bear Rule, without Venom, he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce with Honour and Truth; becauſe he hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the <hi>Stone</hi> of <hi>Fire,</hi> which may be prepared of <hi>Antimony</hi> for the Health of Mortals, and for Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Suſtentation with parcicular profit. For in <hi>Antimony</hi> you may find all Colours, Black, White, Red, Green, Blew, Yellow, and more other mixt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, than can be believed, all which may be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated apart, and known particularly, and ſingularly applied to uſe; according as the Artiſt intends, ſuch an Ordination is to be inſtituted.</p>
            <p>Therefore now will I diſtinctly declare, how Medicine is to be prepared, Venom to be expelled, Fixation to be ſet about, and a true Separation to be made, by which the Evil may be ſubdued and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and the Good triumph and be taken into uſe. In the mean while, let the Lover of Art con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that every of the other Metals may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to every of the Pretious Stones; but this only contains univerſally the Virtues of all Stones;
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:62975:40"/>which thoſe Colours, which it gives forth and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits to the Sight from it ſelf in the Fire, do ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently demonſtrate. Its Tranſparent Redneſs is aſſigned to the Carbuncle, Ruby, and Coral; its Whiteneſs, to the Diamond and Cryſtal; its Blew Colour, to the <hi>Saphire;</hi> Green, to the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald;</hi> Yellow, to the <hi>Jacinth;</hi> its Black, to the <hi>Granate,</hi> which Stone contains in it ſelf a certain Blackneſs occultly abſconded. But as to Metals, the Black is aſſigned to <hi>Saturn,</hi> the Red to Iron, the Yellow to Gold, the Green to Copper, the Blew to Silver, the White to <hi>Mercury,</hi> and its mixture of various Colours is attributed to <hi>Jupiter.</hi> But as all the Colours of all Metals and Precious Stones are clearly found in <hi>Antimony;</hi> ſo alſo all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Virtues of Medicine are no leſs ſhewed in it, than the Colours aforeſaid: but to educe from it all theſe Colours is not the Labour of one man. For our Life is circumſcribed with Limits more ſtrait, than will permit one man by his Labour throughly to learn whatſoever Nature keeps con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed and abſconded in her Boſom. In one cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain way of Preparation, from <hi>Antimony</hi> by diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations is drawn forth an Humour acid and ſharp, like true perfect Vinegar. Another way is prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a ſhining Red Colour, ſweet and ſavoury, as pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Honey or Sugar. Another way, a Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood-liike Bitterneſs proceeds therefrom; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, a certain Acrimony, like ſome Salt-Oyl: thus always one Nature follows another. Again, by Sublimation it is driven to the Olympick Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, like a flying Eagle, red, yellow and white. Alſo forced down by Deſcent, it yields divers Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours and Preparations: alſo by Reverberation, of it is made a Metal, like common Lead. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a tranſparent Glaſs, red, yellow, white, black, and endewed with other Colours: all which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:62975:40"/>are not ſafe to be uſed in Medicine, unleſs they be firſt proved by another <hi>Examen.</hi> Alſo it is reſolved into rare and wonderful Oyls, which are various and manifold, ſome of which are made perfect with Addition, others without mixti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any other things; ſome likewiſe are taken inwardly, others only outwardly applied to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Ulcers, and Wounds. It ſupplies us with ſo many ſeveral Extractions, varied with ſo many Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, as it would tire a <hi>Delphian Apollo</hi> to deſcribe them all; but indeed, all the Mutations of its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which are diſcovered through the Gate of Fire, it by its own Oracles will beſt unfold. Of it is made living Mercury, and Sulphur which burns like common Sulphur, ſo that of that Gunpowder might be made. Of it is made a true and natural <hi>Salt;</hi> and many other things are prepared of the ſame.</p>
            <p>Therefore we begin to ſpeak of the Preparations thereof, as of its <hi>Eſſence, Magiſtery, Arcanum, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixir,</hi> and particular <hi>Tincture,</hi> in which you muſt imploy all diligence and Care; eſpecially when I ſhall in my Writings declare to you the Stone of Fire, and its Preparation, together with other va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Secrets and Arcanums, which indeed are ſcarcely at all known to the World; and which have been little regarded, ſince the <hi>Egyptians, Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians</hi> and <hi>Chaldeans</hi> dyed, who profeſſed theſe Arts: of which notwithſtanding the uſe is very great, for ſearching out the very Fountain of true Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, and all other Works pertinent thereunto.</p>
            <p>Now diligently mind, and with profound Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation conſider all the following Preparations, one ſucceeding another, as I ſhall reveal them. For there is no One inſerted, which hath not its ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Utility, but every of them is uſeful, according as ordained in its State. A fixed Medicine of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony,</hi>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:62975:41"/>expels fixed Diſeaſes and eradicates them; but <hi>Antimony</hi> not fixed, as when it is crude and not prepared, opens and purgeth the Stomach only, but toucheth not the Root of the Diſeaſe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will ſet about the Preparation of all, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertains to <hi>Antimony,</hi> and diſcover all the Keys of its Preparation, which now (as by a new Nativity) are brought to Light, and revealed by Fire, in the ſame ſtate, to which they were ordained by <hi>GOD</hi> their <hi>Creator.</hi> This unlocking and preparing of Mineral <hi>Antimony</hi> is performed by divers Methods and Ways, by the diſpoſure and governance of the Fire, with manifold labour of the Hands, whence proceeds the Operation, Virtue, Power and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the Medicine it ſelf. And ſince <hi>Antimony</hi> to the Aſpect preſents a crude black Colour, mixed with a little whiteneſs, I will firſt ſpeak of its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive alteration, which conſiſts in <hi>Calcination</hi> and <hi>Incineration,</hi> and that is thus made.</p>
            <p>Take Hungarian or other <hi>Antimony,</hi> the beſt you can get, grind it, if poſſible, to an Impalpable Powder; this Powder ſpread Thin all over the Bottom of a Calcining Pan, round or ſquare, which hath a Rim round about, the height of two Fingers thickneſs; ſet this Pan into a Calcining Fornace, and adminiſter to it at firſt a very moderate Fire of Coals, which afterward increaſe gradually: when you ſee a Fume beginning to ariſe from the <hi>Antimony,</hi> ſtir it continually with an Iron <hi>Spatula,</hi> without ceaſing, as long as it wall give forth from it ſelf any Fume. If in Calcining, the <hi>Antimony</hi> melt, or concrete into Clots, then remove it from the Fire, and when cold again reduce it to a ſubtle Powder, and as before calcine it, continually ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring as we ſaid, until no more Fume will aſcend. If need be repeat this Operation ſo often and ſo long, as until that <hi>Antimony</hi> put into the Fire, will
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:62975:41"/>neither fume, nor concrete into Clots, but in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour reſemble White and pure Aſhes: Then is the Calcination of <hi>Antimony</hi> rightly made.</p>
            <p>Put this <hi>Antimony</hi> thus calcined into a Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmiths Crucible ſet in a Fornace, and urge the Fire with Bellows, or put it into a Wind-Fornace, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtring ſuch Fire, as the <hi>Antimony</hi> may flow, like clear and pure Water. Then, that you may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly and infallibly prove, whether the Glaſs made thereof be ſufficiently cocted, and hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired a tranſparent Colour, put a long rod of Iron cold into the Crucible, and part of the Glaſs will ſtick to the Iron, which with an Hammer ſtrike off, and hold up againſt the Light, to ſee whether it be clear, clean and tranſparent; if ſo, it is well, and perfectly mature.</p>
            <p>Here let my Reader, unlearned and but a Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in Art, know (for I write not to men skilled in this Art, who have often experienced the powers of the Fire, but to Candidates, <hi>Tyro</hi>'s,<note n="*" place="margin">Rightly doth <hi>Baſilius</hi> ſay, he writes to the <hi>Tyro</hi>'s of this Art; becauſe he begins with the Glaſs of <hi>Antimony,</hi> that is, from the very Rudiments of <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtry,</hi> and ſo accurately teacheth to make that, as no man how ignorant ſoever can be deceived therein: yet the Ancients have not ſeldom experienced, how often they have erred in the <hi>Praxis,</hi> for ſuch I have written theſe <hi>Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</hi> For me, let every One pleaſe himſelf in his own Writings: ſurely I think I have offered ſomewhat, which Poſterity will always thankfully accept. For although I did for ſeveral years most diligently read <hi>Baſilius</hi> and other Maſters of the Art of Arts, and in Labouring followed them, as exactly as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly I could, yet I committed ſo many Errors (the remembrance of which fills me with Horror) loſt ſo much Money, and was ſo often conſtrained to amend thoſe Errors with labour, as I have compaſſion of all Thoſe, who would enter into this way, incited thereunto by their earneſt deſire to help their Neighbours: for I have no reſpect to Others, who aim at nothing but Riches, and would make ſo noble an Art ſubſervient to <hi>Avarice,</hi> the worſt of all Vices; let them ſustain the dammage they deſerve to ſuffer.

If you have much Tincture, you muſt have a great Cucurbit; if Little, a leſs will ſerve. For if you take a greater Veſſel, than your Tincture requires, the Vinegar muſt neceſſarily have a greater Fire to cauſe it to aſcend, by reaſon of the height it muſt unavoidably riſe, or it cannot be diſtilled; and in ſuſtaining ſo forcible a Fire, there is great danger of Corrupting the Tincture it ſelf.

            <p>This Oyl is the <hi>Quinteſcence,</hi> and the higheſt, that can be written of <hi>Antimony;</hi> as you may find in my former Writings, wherein I have made a ſhort Declaration of <hi>Antimony,</hi> and in which I ſhewed alſo, that there are four <hi>Inſtruments</hi> required for its <hi>Preparation,</hi> and the fifth is that, in which <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> hath fixed his Reſidence.

The firſt Labour is <hi>Calcinatian</hi> and <hi>Liquefaction</hi> into Glaſs. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is <hi>Digeſtion,</hi> by which <hi>Extraction</hi> is performed. The third is <hi>Coagulation.</hi> The fourth is <hi>Diſtillati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> into Oyl, and after that Separation follows <hi>Fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,</hi> by the ultimate <hi>Coagulation,</hi> through which the Matter is deduced to a perlucid <hi>Ficry Stone:</hi> which that it may operate upon Metals, muſt be fermented, for acquiring its penetrative Property;
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:62975:47"/>but not ſo much, as that Ancient Stone of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, becauſe it is not Univerſal, but only tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth particularly. Touching which, about the End of this Book, more ſhall be ſpoken when we treat of the Stone of Fire.</p>
            <p>This diſtilled Oyl<note n="*" place="margin">Had I not known <hi>Baſilius,</hi> I ſhould have thought him, in this place to have dealt like a Deceiver, or Vagabond Medicaſter with you: but the Matter it ſelf unto me, ſo often ſpeaks for him, as I religiouſly ſcruple even in the leaſt to doubt his Promiſes. For whatſoever I have experienced (but there are very few Proceſſes contained in this Book, which I have not tryed: for He, from the very firſt, was my <hi>Teacher, Friend</hi> and <hi>Patron</hi>) I have found ſo very efficacious beyond the <hi>Author</hi>'s Promiſes, that it ſeems to me, he hath been ſparing in declaring the virtues of his <hi>Medicaments,</hi> leaſt in prayſing them, he ſhould be thought too much to commend himſelf. Yet I ſhall not here in his ſtead, undertake to comment much on their laudable Virtues. Let him who believes not, make tryal, that he may know. Whoſoever ſhall by his own incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity be deterred from experiencing the Truth hereof, he will ſuffer puniſhmtnt enough for his Offence, by the Want of the fruit of the ſame. For this Oyl, if rightly uſed in its time, is a Medicine truly univerſal. Conſider, I pray, what I ſay, if rightly uſed in its time, that is, the Body being firſt purged from groſs and crnde Humours, and general Medicines uſed (as you may remember I did before admoniſh) this Oyl is an Univerſal Medicine, for healing all Diſeaſes Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. For <hi>Chymiſts</hi> are not ſo mad, or conceited, by reaſon of the Goodneſs and Virtue of their Medicaments, as not to judge ſome Diſeaſes to be Unſanable. Who can reſtore any of the Principal Members abſumed by putridneſs? yet I would not have all Diſeaſes judged unſanable, by theſe our Chymical Remedies, which are every where vulgarly condemned as ſuch. As for Example, how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten have I reſtored the <hi>Cryſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Only of tllis Medicament I ſay, that it heals <hi>Feavers</hi> of every kind; yea, even the <hi>Quartan</hi> it ſelf (that ancient <hi>Reproach</hi> of <hi>Phyſicians</hi>) and in Chronical Diſtempers manifeſts wonderful Effects. Here among many of my Obſervations I will give you one only Experiment. In the Year <hi>1665.</hi> A young Maid, aged twenty one Years, ſwollen to an enormous Groſsneſs with the Dropſie, came to me for help. I took this only for her Medicine. For I gave her no other thing, then this very Medicament twice a Day, to which I dayly added a Cliſter: and in twenty dayes ſhe had ſweat ſo much, as her Body was leſſened half an Ell. Within that space of twenty Days, as I ſaid, ſhe alſo voyded of urine (provoked by the ſame Medicament) not a little, but her Sweat was wonderful.
<p>
                     <hi>Note:</hi> my <hi>Friend,</hi> and <hi>Lover</hi> of <hi>Art,</hi> thac this Oyl, whether you prepare it. your ſelf, or receive it from another prepared by him, doth not imitate other Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoreticks in operating, which being uſed, will in their firſt Doſe provoke Sweats. For if this be given to a Patient whoſe Body is obſtructed with Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, the firſt Doſe acts nothing, but gently opens the Paſſages, that Sweats may be procured; the next day it cauſeth a gentle and kindly breathing of Sweats only; the third Day it Sweats moderately; but the fourth Day, and thence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, it cauſeth ſuch an abundance of Sweat, as the Waters proceeding thence run through the Bed upon the Floor. Here is need of a true Phyſician; <hi>Hercules Club</hi> will profit little, if not in che Hand of <hi>Hercules</hi> himſelf.</p>
               </note> of which we have now ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, effects all things, that are neceſſary to be known by a <hi>Phyſician,</hi> and which he hath need of, in his <hi>Cures.</hi>

            <p>The Doſe of it before Coagulation is eight Grains taken in Wine.

And this Medicine can no more be burned by the Fire, than the Feathers of that unknown <hi>Salamander:</hi> for it conſumes all Symptoms in the Body, like conſuming Fire, to which it is deſervedly likened; it drives away every Evil, and expels all That, which <hi>Aurum-Potabile</hi> is capable to expel.

Which Unhappy Succeſs of this Medicine is cauſed from the Mercurial Properties, with which it is too much impregnated (as <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilius</hi> well notes in this Place) and which I am wont to correct in this manner.
<p>Take Glaſs of <hi>Antimony,</hi> moſt pure, <hi>℥iiij. Venetian Borax ℥ſs.</hi> melt them together.

That this <hi>Emetick Wine</hi> may be given to the Sick without peril, Exprience the moſt certain Miſtreſs of <hi>Phyſicians</hi> hath taught me, and yet more than this: for when the Wine poured in the Powder ſhall be all exhauſted, if you pour on more French Wine, that will alſo be imbibed with the ſame Virtues. For here <hi>Antimony</hi> diſcovers in it ſelf to be ſomewhat, that is of all wonderful Things the moſt admirable: becauſe it contains in it ſelf inexhaustible Treaſures, and although you take from it, yet you diminiſh not the Virtues thereof.

By Example, I ſhall teach you ſomewhat more clearly. Diſtilled Water extracts the Tincture from Sulphur, made of the Glaſs of <hi>Antimony</hi> by diſtilled Vinegar. But if in this Operation you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade your ſelf you have ſeparated the Pure from the Impure, you will be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: for this Water imbibes a certain Salt, which infects the Tincture; but Spirit of Wine rectified is its proper <hi>Menſtruum:</hi> becauſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>When the Fermentation is made, I ſhall have need of a vaſt Quantity of Paper to declare all the <hi>Arcanum</hi>'s of Nature, which by this Medicine are effected beyond the Opinion of all men.

Preparation of <hi>Antimony,</hi> and deduce it to Uſe; then, he himſelf will dayly find more Praiſe, and learn from it more Operations than any of the other Phyſicians could have preſcribed him.</p>
            <p>When you ſhall have brought <hi>Antimony</hi> ſo far; and duely perfected your Work, in which you are to act prudently, and the matter is to be largely and profoundly weighed, that by Labour you may acquire Experience; then may you boaſt that you have obtained the Magiſtery, which is known or communicated to few. This Magiſtery mix'd with a Solution or Tincture of Corals, and exhibited with Cordial Water effects Wonders in Diſeaſes, that are to be cured by purifying the Blood!

            <p>Take, in the name of the Lord, good <hi>Minera</hi> of <hi>Antimony,</hi> grind it ſubtlely, and ſublime it with half ſo much <hi>Sal-Armoniack.</hi> Whatſoever ſhall be ſublimed put into a Glaſs Retort, and thrice diſtil it, ſeparating the <hi>Feces</hi> every time.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and is a Medicine apt for thoſe who deſire Gentle Purgations.</p>
            <p>Here perhaps ſome <hi>Phyſician</hi> may wonder, how 'tis poſſible, that this Medicine ſhould cauſe mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and eaſie Purgations, when as <hi>Antimony</hi> is a
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:62975:53"/>Matter vehement and forcible, and to it is joyned Rubarb, which of it ſelf alſo hath a Purging Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty. But let him ceaſe his admiration, and know that the venomous purging power of <hi>Antimony</hi> is by this Preparation ſo mortified, as it can appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend or expel nothing; but as ſoon as ſome purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Simple is adjoyned to it, it then according to the powers of its own Nature performs the Office of opening and purging. But <hi>Antimony</hi> prepared hath no action upon the<note n="*" place="margin">Note here very ſeriouſly, that <hi>Galenick Catharticks</hi> have power of expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, but not of Correcting Humors; but Chymical Purgers are endued with ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Faculty; and certainly it ſhould not be minded how much is expelled, but how much is healed, which the occult power of Medicaments prepared Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally doth much better effect, than that common and publick violence of purging forcibly.</note> Stomach, thence to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel its impurities; but by the purging Medicine, its adjunct, acquires a more open Field, and therein can operate without Impediment any other way, and diſcern, yea ſearch ont the way of Effecting that better, to which it was ordained and prepared, without hindrance.</p>
            <p>I would have all men to credit theſe my words, ſince I have no neceſſity to write other than the Truth. This <hi>Elixir</hi> in ſuch manner prepared, as I have taught, penetrates and purgeth the Body, as <hi>Antimony</hi> purgeth Gold, and frees it from all Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: So that if I would at large commemorate all the powers and virtues thereof, I muſt put up my Supplications to the <hi>GOD</hi> of Heaven, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat him to vouchſafe me a longer Life, that I might laud his wonderful Works, and ſearch out further, and according to Verity communicate to others what I have found, thac they with me excited to admiration, may publickly render thanks to their <hi>Creator,</hi> for his ſo great Bleſſings.</p>
            <pb n="86" facs="tcp:62975:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>But to proceed in my purpoſe, having once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, I here deſcribe the Virtues of <hi>Antimony,</hi> as far as I have experienced them; yet what is hid from my knowledge, I ought to paſs over in ſilence. For it becomes me not to give my Judgment of things unknown, and which I have not my ſelf ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimented, but I leave them, commending the ſame to other Judges, who with ſtudy and labour in this Subject, have made ſome good progreſs. No one man can be ſo expert in knowing the Virtues of <hi>Antimony,</hi> as nothing ſhall remain unknown by him, not only by reaſon of the ſhortneſs of his Life (as I before ſaid) but alſo, and chiefly becauſe ſome new thing is dayly found in it.</p>
            <p>Therefore, let men know, that <hi>Antimony</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le purgeth Gold, cleanſeth and frees it from every peregrine Matter, and from all other Metals, but alſo (by a power innate in it ſelf) effects the ſame in Men and Beaſts. If a Farmer purpoſe in himſelf to keep up and fatten any of his Cattle, as for Example an Hog; two or three days before, let him give to the Swine a convenient Doſe of crude <hi>Antimany,</hi> about half a dram mix'd with his Food, that by it he may be purged; through which Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation he will not only acquire an Appetite to his Meat, but the ſooner increaſe and be fatned. And if any Swine labour with a Diſeaſe about his Liver or other Parts, or elſe be Leprous, <hi>Antimony</hi> cauſeth the Leproſie to be dryed up and expelled.</p>
            <p>This Example ſeems indeed to ſound ſomewhat groſs and ruſtical, to the Ears of Great men eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially; but my purpoſe in propoſing it only was to the end, that private Men and <hi>Laicks,</hi> whoſe Brains were not by Nature fabricated to the moſt ſubtle Philoſophy of the Learned, may ſee the Truth here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, in the very Operation it ſelf, with their own Eyes; alſo that by this rude Propoſal, they might
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:62975:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>give greater credit to my other Writings, in which I have ſpoken a little more ſubtely of theſe Things. Yet I would have no man, following me as his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, to give a Medicine of Crude <hi>Antimony</hi> to men; for mute Animals can in their Stomach con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coct much more hard Foods, than the tender Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion of Men is able to digeſt. Wherefore, he who would rightly and with profit uſe <hi>Antimony,</hi> he muſt learn the Preparation thereof firſt, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward know the Doſe, as what is convenient for the Young, and what for the Old; how much may be given to robuſt Bodies, and how much to the weak, in which no ſmall Myſtery of this Art conſiſts, the ignorance of which will do more hurt than an imprudent Phyſician can do good.</p>
            <p>Should I confirm all things by Examples, that would be the Cauſe of a very Prolix Writing; therefore I will break off this Diſcourſe, and paſs on to another Preparation of <hi>Antimony,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe its fixedneſs; which acts like Wine, from which its Spirit is ſubſtracted and ſeparated from its Body. This Spirit heals the Body internally, and if externally applied, draws to it ſelf all the Heat of a part inflamed: but, on the contrary, when of the Wine, Vinegar is made, it cools, either in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly or outwardly applied; although the Wine and Vinegar have their Original from the ſame Root, and proceed from the ſame Stock. The Reaſon of this diverſity is, becauſe Vinegar is made through digeſtion only, by which Putrefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Wine follows, together with a Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Fixation: but on the contrary, Spirit of Wine is made with Separation by diſtilling, or vegetable ſubliming, which renders the Spirit volatile. By like reaſon <hi>Antimony</hi> is prepared, and according to its divers Preparations hath divers Effects, and diverſly communicates its Gifts to us, which are
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:62975:55"/>ſcarcely comprehenſible by the humane Intellect. But the Fixedneſs thereof, touching which I here treat, is thus prepared.</p>
            <p>Take of <hi>Antimony</hi> as much as you will, grind it to a ſubtle Powder, which put into a <hi>Cucurbit,</hi> and pour on it of <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> ſo much as will ſtand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove it the breadth of ſix Fingers; and having well and firmly cloſed the Veſſel, place it in a ſubtle heat for ten Days, that the Matter may be extracted. Decant off this Extraction pure and clear, and filter it, that it may be free from all feculencies and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purities; then put this Extraction into a Glaſs-Body, and abſtract all the <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> by Diſtillation in Aſhes or Sand, and in the bottom the Powder of <hi>Antimony</hi> will remain yellow and dry. Upon this pour diſtilled Rain-water, and put it in a like Glaſs in moderate heat, and you will have a Red Extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This again filter, and gently diſtil off the Rain-water by <hi>B. M.</hi> and the Powder will remain red in the Bottom. Upon this red Powder pour ſtrong diſtilled Vinegar: this Vinegar will in ſome time draw to it ſelf the Colour red as Blood, and put down <hi>Feces.</hi> Afterward diſtil off the Vinegar, and there will again remain a red Powder. This Powder reverberate continually for three days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether without ceaſing in an open Fire; This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done, abſtract the Tincture from it by Spirit of Wine, and ſeparate the <hi>Feces</hi> remaining from the Tincture. All theſe Works being with ſo great labour performed, again ſeparate the Spirit of Wine by diſtillation in <hi>Balneo,</hi> and a fixed<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Diaphoretick Antimony</hi> is ſold in Shops, but what here the Author ſhews us, by the name of Fixed Powder of <hi>Antimony,</hi> is not to be bought for Silver or Gold; the Virtues of which ſo far exceed all that, of which the Common Sort are Partakers: In vain with ſo great attention and ſtudy (of which in preparing this Powder, there is very great need) did our Philoſopher intend this Work, if theſe Mysteries of ſo great Effects muſt come to the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Vulgar, or be publickly ſold for Money. Let him who attains to this fixed Powder uſe it in Chronical Diſeaſes, especially where Sweats are to be excited, and he will ſee Effects cauſing him to rejoyce, if he uſe it in himſelf; and by which he will be glorified, if he uſe it in others.</note> Red Powder will remain, which operates wonderfully.</p>
            <pb n="89" facs="tcp:62975:55"/>
            <p>Half a dram of this being taken thrice a day, <hi>viz.</hi> Morning, Noon, and Night, or oftner, hurts no man; for it expels all clotted Blood out of the Body, and being long taken ſecurely opens all pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillous Impoſthums, and expels them; radically cures the <hi>French Diſeaſe,</hi> cauſeth new Hairs to grow, and notably renovates the whole man.</p>
            <p>Now, ſince I have taught to make a fixed Powder of <hi>Antimony,</hi> and the Extraction thereof very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious for Uſe, leaving this Diſcourſe, I purpoſe briefly to treat of the Flowers of <hi>Antimony,</hi> which may be many ways prepared. But the greateſt part<note n="*" place="margin">How much <hi>Chymiſtry</hi> was impeached by Calumnies, in the times of <hi>Baſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> is manifeſt by the very many Reliques of Writers, with which ſome <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logicians,</hi> imprudently judging what they understood not, and <hi>Politicians</hi> (not much more prudent than them) have defamed their own Books; and in the mean while alſo given occaſion to Others, more throughly ſearching into the matter, of judging thoſe very Authors, with no greater circumspection to have likewiſe bespattered other innocent Perſons with their Cenſure. I do not here ſpeak of thoſe Writers, who ſharply reprehend certain Vagabond Sophisters, that covering their own Wickedneſs, under the Pretext of a moſt noble Art, do by a great Name impoſe great Frauds upon the People. For this kind of men are not only worthy of ſevere Reprehenſion, but alſo of due Puniſhment. But, what Evil do they deſerve, if under their Denomination the Good be abuſed? Why is the moſt certain and ſo ſalutary and profitable an Art proſcribed? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are men found, which uſe not the Art it ſelf, but the Name and Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of this Art. Yet I am unwilling to prolong this Apology, leſt Envy, which hath been the greateſt Cauſe of Calumny, fall upon me in this manner la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting, whilſt I hear <hi>Baſilius</hi> encouraging his, and have reaſon to applaud our own Times, in which ſome part of that moſt thick Cloud, which caſt out ſo many Thunders, is already vaniſhed. In Shops they now ſell Medicaments, Chymically prepared (as they ſay) and thoſe very Perſons, who are willing moſtly to be esteemed <hi>Hippocratick Diſciples,</hi> ſcarcely dare to condemn <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtry,</hi> and ſince they call into uſe what are made by the Chymical Art, they cannot deny it. Are not thoſe Times at hand, in which <hi>Elias</hi> the <hi>Artiſt,</hi> the Revealer of greater <hi>Myſteries</hi> is to come? Of whoſe Coming <hi>Paracelſus</hi> ſo clearly propheſied in various places of his Writings? Perhaps it will be worth our while, for the Solace of the oppreſſed Diſciples of <hi>Baſilius,</hi> to quote certain places, in which he predicts the coming of <hi>Elias</hi> not then born: which if any One cammodiouſly interpret, as all other Sayings of that man are to be taken, he will find nothing of abſurdity in them, unleſs he reſolve to diſcover his own abſurd Stupidity, or wicked Envy. In the Book of Minerals, <hi>Chap. 8. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racelſus</hi> thus writes: What is moſt vile, <hi>GOD</hi> ſuffers to be diſcovered, but what is of greater moment is yet hid from the Vulgar, until the coming of <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Artiſt;</hi> others read, until the Art of <hi>Elias,</hi> when he comes. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, in his Book of Minerals, Treatiſe the firſt. It is indeed true <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> that many things lie hid in the Earth, which I, as well as others am ignorant of. For this I know, <hi>GOD,</hi> in time to come will manifeſt his Wonders, and bring to light many more of them, then unto this Day have been known by us. Alſo this is true; there is nothing abſconded, which ſhall not he revealed; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there cometh One, whoſe <hi>Magnale</hi> lives not yet, who ſhall reveal many Things.
<p>Therefore be comforted, be comforted, O Lover of <hi>Chymiſtry,</hi> and prepare the way of that <hi>Elias,</hi> who brings happy times, and will reveal more Secrets than our Anceſtors, by reaſon of Envy, and the Iniquity of their Days durſt diſcover. Whoſoever thou art, converſing in this Art, confer ſome ſmall matter to this fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity; and let us give the World that Medicine, which by reaſon of evil Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors predominant, it cannot take all at once, by degrees, that it may gradually recover of its Diſeaſe, and the Times of <hi>Elias</hi> come (for Arts alſo, as well as is underſtood of other things, have their <hi>Elias,</hi> ſaith <hi>Theophraſtus</hi>) where it will be lawful for us to ſpeak freely of theſe things, and openly to do good to our Neighbours, without perſecution of the Impious. Read, underſtand, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort your ſelf with theſe.</p>
               </note> of men neither can diſcourſe of, nor anſwer to theſe; becauſe they have not learned the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of ſuch Operations: but the leaſt part, <hi>viz.</hi> the Diſciples, Apoſtles, and Followers of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyrick Art,</hi> will more eſteem my Writings, more diligently read them, and more prudently give Judgement of the ſame.</p>
            <pb n="90" facs="tcp:62975:56"/>
            <p>But, my Diſciple and Follower, if you will imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate me, my advice is, that you take up your Croſs, at firſt, and ſuffer as I have ſuffered; learn to bear Perſecution, as I have already born it, labour, as

            <p>Now, to proceed in my Inſtruction, touching the <hi>Flowers</hi> of <hi>Antimony,</hi> it is to be underſtood, that the true <hi>Flores</hi> of <hi>Antimony,</hi> may be prepared, not one, but various ways, as is known to every <hi>Spagyriſt.</hi> There are ſome who drive them, mix'd with <hi>Sal-Armoniack,</hi> over by Retort; then they edulcorate them, by waſhing away the <hi>Sal-Armoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack,</hi> and theſe they greatly eſteem; for theſe Flowers are of a fair and white Colour.

            <p>I mixed the red Flowers of <hi>Antimony</hi> with Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cothar of Vitriol, and ſublimed them together thrice. So, the Eſſence of Vitriol aſcends with them, and the <hi>Flores</hi> are more ſtrong: which being done, I extract the ſame Flowers with Spirit of Wine.

            <p>Theſe are my prepared Flowers of <hi>Antimony,</hi> which I adminiſtred to my Brethren, and others,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:62975:57"/>who in there Neceſſities, required help of me, for their Souls ſpiritual, in reſpect of my Eccleſiaſtical State, &amp; for their Bodies temporal, by reaſon of the Truſt they repoſed in my Art.

            <p>But touching the Sublimations of <hi>Antimony,</hi> which are afterward called Flowers; let the Reader fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obſerve, <hi>viz.</hi> that they are like Waters, which break out in high Mountains. Now, of the difference of waters, which ariſe in the higheſt Mountains, yea in higher than they, if ſuch can be found; for even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them would the waters aſcend; ſince it is known, that in the tops of the higheſt Mountains, Springs do very often iſſue it; and of other waters which are found by digging deep in the Earth, and by follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Springs muſt be ſearched out: any man may judge that the <hi>Matrix</hi> of waters in the Earth, is on one part more aboundantly repleniſhed with the Riches of waters, then on another; ſince every Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath a peculiar <hi>Matrix,</hi> either ſtrong or weak, according as it is produced by the <hi>Sydus,</hi> whence Elements derive their Original and have being Now, when ſuch a <hi>Matrix</hi> is ſtrong and potent in the Earth, it can drive forth its Seed ſtrongly and efficaciouſly from it ſelf, by a vehement Preſſure,

            <p>If any fatuate man hear this my Diſcourſe, he will ſay, I am either mad or drunk with Wine; but this will be no other than a Reproach, like to that, which was caſt upon the Diſciples of our Saviour. Of Sublimation, the Reaſon is the ſame; for as Waters, which are many times found in the higheſt Mountains, are more ſalubrious, and more cool than thoſe, which by digging deep into the Earth are found in Plains; ſo, if the Matter by preſſure &amp; force of ſire be driven upwards to the Mountains of the Ancient Wiſe men, who died long before my time, the Earth, which for the moſt part is unprofitable, remains until its Salt ſhall be extracted from it for its proper uſe. Thus is made Separation, by which the Evil may be diſtinguiſhed from the Good, the Pure from the Impure, the thick from the thin, the ſubtle from that which is not ſubtle, and the Venom from the Medicament. We miſerable Mortals, by Death which we have deſerved for our Sins are put into the Earth, until we putreſie by time, and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to ſilths; and afterward by the Heavenly Fire and Heat raiſed, clarified, and exalted to a Celeſtial Sublimation, where all our <hi>Feces,</hi> all Sins, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Impurity ſhall be ſeparated, and we made the Sons of <hi>GOD,</hi> and of Eternal Life, unto which the Lord of his Mercy and Goodneſs bring me with you. But I hope no Man will take amiſs this Comparation of the Mundane with the Spiritual, <hi>viz.</hi> the Heavenly Exaltation with the Earthly Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limation.
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:62975:58"/>For no man ſhould ſuppoſe what I have done, to be done without Reaſon, but rather know, that I am ignorant what is white or black, how much the tenebrous and diſmal Air differs from the ſerene and clear Heaven. Therefore let us break off this Diſcourſe, and produce another Preparation of <hi>Antmony.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let the Diſciple, Apoſtle, and faithful Imitator of Art, underſtand this Inſtruction, and according to the true Philoſophick Doctrine faithfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that every Extraction from <hi>Antimony</hi> (as alſo from all other Things) hath great difference in O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, which neither conſiſts in the Matter, nor is known by the Matter, from which it is drawn; but conſiſts and remains in the Preparation, and in the Addition, by which the Virtue is extracted from the Matter, as is known by Experience; as for Example. Whatſoever is Extracted from <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony,</hi> or any other thing with Spirit of Wine, hath a far other virtue of Operating, than thoſe, which are extracted with good and ſharp Vinegar. The Cauſes of this I have already hinted in my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Writings; but the principal Cauſe is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all Extractions made with Spirit of Wine, from <hi>Antimony,</hi> or any purging Herbs, Roots, or Seeds (underſtand of the firſt Extraction) power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully expel by Seidge: but on the contrary, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is extracted with Vinegar, purgeth not downward, but rather prevents that, and retains in a certain peculiar manner, by which the Volatile is changed into fixed.</p>
            <p>This is a ſingular Secret, and an <hi>Arcanum</hi> of great price; but there are none, or very few found, who mind ſuch things; becauſe many things are hidden, and lie deeply buried in this <hi>Arcanum,</hi> which no One, either Maſter or Servant, nor any Wiſe man of this World hath unto this Day obſerved or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered.</p>
            <pb n="95" facs="tcp:62975:58"/>
            <p>Therefore the Extraction of <hi>Antimony</hi> is made two ways, <hi>viz.</hi> with Vinegar, and with Spirit of Wine. Vinegar obſtructs, and Spirit of Wine, of it ſelf powerfully expels and cauſeth Urine, as alſo Stools; as elſewhere in another manner is ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and eſpecially where I ſpeak of my Twelve Keys, as namely, that the Extraction of Glaſs of <hi>Antimony</hi> moderately purgeth; but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary the Extraction of the ſame Glaſs, which is made with Vinegar purgeth not: which is true and not permixt with any falſity. But this Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence gives occaſion of thinking and reflecting, by which way of Reaſoning, Nature gives promotion and production to a true Philoſopher. But it is a thing much to be admired, that every Subject, which is firſt of all extracted with Spirit of Wine, ſhould have a Purging Property. Yet when Glaſs of <hi>Antimony</hi> is from the beginning extracted with diſtilled Vinegar, and that Vinegar again abſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and theu the <hi>Antemony</hi> extracted with Spirit of Wine, all its venomous purging virtue paſſeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and no ſign thereof remains, nor aſſumes it to it ſelf any power of provoking Stools; but it performs its Operations by Sweat, and other ways, chiefly by Salivation and Ejection by the Mouth; it ſearcheth out all hurtful Evils in the Body, purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Blood, heals the Diſeaſes of the Lungs, and profits thoſe who are ſtrait-breaſted, and troubled with a frequent Cough. In a word it Cures very many Diſeaſes, alſo aſſwageth a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Cough, and whatſoever is of that Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and is a Medicine very admirable.</p>
            <p>Moreover, there is another Extraction of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> made in this manner. Grind crude <hi>Antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> to powder, and pour upon it ſtrong Vinegar, not of Wine, but made of its proper <hi>Minera,</hi> and expoſe the Mixture in a Veſſel well cloſed to the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:62975:59"/>
               <hi>Solar</hi> heat; then, after ſome time the Vinegar will be tinged with a Blood-like Colour, pour off this Extraction clear, filter it, and diſtil by Alembick in Sand: then again, in diſtilling, it ſhews admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Colours, pleaſant to the Sight, and wonderful in Aſpect. This Oyl<note n="*" place="margin">Here thy Sincerity, <hi>Valentine,</hi> is ſuspected. Who can by this thy Preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption make this <hi>Quinteſſence,</hi> which <hi>Petrus</hi> the Spaniard, in his Book <hi>Of the Quinteſſenc of all Things,</hi> deſtrvedly extols, as the greateſt Secret of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy? What ſhall I ſay? Malice makes thee, not a perverſe, but timerous man, fearing, leaſt if <hi>Arcanum</hi>'s ſhould be communicated openly to the wicked, they would do more hurt with them then good. This Proceſs ſeems to me to be purpoſely deſcribed obſcurely by this Religious Man (why elſe ſhould he not have written otherwiſe!) becauſe he knew the Sons of Art would underſtand it by his Preſcript. But that you, Reader, may underſtand, you have not in vain spent your Money in buying, or time in reading theſe Commentaries, I will clearly and nakedly diſcover to you, how I my ſelf have oftentimes performed this very Work: do you give good heed to all Things, that you may not at all be deficient; for the Operations are ſo concatinated, or co-linked together, as one being omitted, or negligently performed, all the other are spoyled, and your labour cannot anſwer your Deſires.
<p>Take of the beſt <hi>Minera</hi> of <hi>Antimony,</hi> which is friable (for if you take crude <hi>Antimony,</hi> as <hi>Baſilius</hi> ſeems to indicate, you can effect nothing; becauſe it hath already loſt its most ſubtle Sulphur in the firſt Distillation) grind it to ſo ſubtle a Powder, as it may paſs through a Tiffany Seive: put it into a <hi>Cucurbit,</hi> and pour upon it Vinegar, which according to Art is distilled from its proper <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nera.</hi> Set it in Digeſtion for forty Days, and (if you have exactly obſerved all things, which are hereunto required) your Vinegar will be tinged with a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour red as Blood. This red Tincture poured off by Inclination, put into a Retort, and gently abstract the Vinegar. The Powder remaining extract with ſpirit of Wine, that it alſo may contract a blood-like Colour. Put this Extraction into a Circulatory Veſſel, like to this, the Figure of which I here expoſe; becauſe I never found any more apt to render the Spirits volatile: Then place this double Veſſel in <hi>B. M.</hi> to be digested ſo long, as until you ſee the Tincture raiſe it ſelf upwards and paſsover volatile by Alembeck; ſeeing this, cool your Veſſel, and put all the Matter into a <hi>Cucurbit,</hi> and distil the Spirit according to Art, which will paſsover the Helm as red as Blood. Then again abſtract the Spirit, and you will have a moſt ponderous thick Oyl.</p>
                  <p>How this Oyl ſhould after this be joyned with its own Salt, and united, we elſewhere ſpeak; the uſe of which in amending Metals is very great. Here we have deſcribed it, and brought it ſo far, as it becomes a moſt excellent Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine in grievous Diſeaſes, which are in all places accounted uncurable. It performs its whole Operation by Sweats. And ſince there is no Diſeaſe, which it helps not; what need is there to name any? It is better to be altogether Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, then to detract from its praiſes, by reciting a few. There is no man who hath made any Progreſs in Chymistry, that knows not what the Quinteſſence of <hi>Antimony</hi> is.</p>
               </note> 
at length becomes Red as Blood, and leaves many <hi>Feces</hi> and prevails againſt many Infirmities: for its ſingular Virtue and Uſe is commanded in the Leproſie; the New Diſeaſe lately riſen amongſt the Souldiers is by it conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and dried up, and indeed it effects Wonders.</p>

            <p>The <hi>Phyſician</hi> before all Things, ſhould dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently contemplate its uſe, according to his own Experience and Knowledge; but eſpecially com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating its Preparation in a due manner, without being weary of his labour, or forgetting any of thoſe Things which are preſcribed to be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>Again, another Extraction of <hi>Antimony,</hi> is thus inſtituted. (Take, in the Name of the Lord, of <hi>Antimony</hi> and crude <hi>Tartar,</hi> of each equal parts; put theſe well mixed together in Powders, into a ſtrong Crucible, which will not ſuffer the Spirits to penetrate it, and burn this Matter in the Fire, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the <hi>Tartar</hi> be wholy combuſt: this work muſt be done in a Wind-Fornace. Grind this burnt Matter to a ſubtle Powder, and pour on that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Water firſt made hot, and ſo edulcorate the Matter by Lixiviating. And ſo it becomes a <hi>Liver</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">The <hi>Liver</hi> is a Cauſe of much Diſcourſe in Banquets, and the <hi>Liver</hi> of <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony</hi> will be to us no ſmall Occaſion of the like in Chymical Operations. But in the firſt place conſider, than instead of Crude Tartar, it is better to take Salt of Tartar, not only for decelerating the Operation (for otherwiſe it muſt be melted ſo long, as until the Tartar be changed into Salt) but chiefly, that you may have Glaſs of a far better Colour. Alſo <hi>Baſilius</hi> forgot, or for ſome Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons did omit, to appoint the Glaſs firſt to be poured into a Platter made hot, and then beaten to powder in an hot Mortar: otherwiſe the Glaſs, by reaſon of the Salt of Tartar, as ſoon as it takes the cold Air is changed into a certain Pulſe or Pap. Beſides, he omitted to determine the Quanticy of Water, in which this Powder ſhould be diſſolved, that we may have a more fair and deep Colour; in which Exaltation of Colour very much is ſited. Alſo the Precipitation of the <hi>Liver</hi> from the Water, which muſt be made with Vinegar, he involved in Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; although this, and the above mentioned, are neceſſary in this Operation.
<p>Here I am unwilling to forbear to admoniſh, that not only in this, but in every Melting of <hi>Antimony,</hi> the <hi>Artiſt</hi> ought to obſerve the Face of Heaven, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin his Work when the ſame is clear and ſerene. If you do otherwiſe, you will in vain deplore the Obſcurity of the Colour in your <hi>Liver</hi> of <hi>Antimony.</hi> For if you laugh at me, attributing much Virtue to the Influences of the Stars, I ſhall deride you, deploring the unluckie Succeſs of many Proceſſes. But I would not digreſs ſo far, as to take on me to prove the Virtues of Celestial Influences, againſt men, either knowing ſo little, as they canot understand, or having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced ſomewhat do not diſcern; but in the mean while are ſo obstinate, as they will not believe thoſe things which they ſee, have tried, and in very deed found to be ſo. I would no more urge Reaſons againſt theſe men, then againſt theſe, who deny even the Mutation of Metals by the Stone of Philoſophers. We judge ſuch men more worthy of Contempt than Refutation, who ſay that is not poſſible, which they have beheld with their Eyes, and done with their hands: for it is very rude to ſay, <hi>I deny, I deny, who proves?</hi> Theſe perverſe men by their thus acting, do ſometimes-provoke the patience of good ingenious Artists, judging that they, with a certain Zeal of confirming what they aſſert, will proceed ſo far, as to diſcover to them their Experiment of ſo excellent an Art. But I do not think that any of them, who have obtained the Mystery will be ſo imprudent, as unadviſedly to caſt Pearls before Swine, and to diſcover to the unworthy, what <hi>GOD</hi> hath revealed to him; or give them of the Bread he Eats, which is not to be caſt to Dogs.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, returning to the Matter from whence I digreſſed, I affirm, that there are ſome times of the year, in which if <hi>Liver</hi> if <hi>Antimony</hi> be made, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated with a due <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> it will be imbibed with altogether another Colour, and be endued with other Virtues than that, which is made at another time; and that, both for Metals, and for healing the Infirmities of men, as I my ſelf have experienced in many grievous Diſeaſes, and Symptoms of Diſeaſes. I will alſo add this: from the <hi>Liver</hi> of <hi>Antimony</hi> may be extracted a Redneſs with Spirit of Wine, which Redneſs is made volatile, and paſſeth over the Helm, which alſo may be exhibited to all without danger. Nor is there any great need of that Caution of <hi>Baſilius</hi> (even before the Redneſs is volatilized) that it muſt be given in a ſmall Quantity. For being given from thirty to forty, or fifty Drops, it ſweats very moderately, and doth not Purge or Vomit: but it effects wonders in purging the Blood, extirpating the Roots of a Diſeaſe; and rendring the Patient vigorous, by inſenſible Expiration, and its occult Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. This Vendible Wine needs not the Buſh of Eloquence to commend it to the Sick; who once having experienced its Virtues, know what it can do, and that it as much anſwers their Deſires, as they esteem their Money.</p>
               </note>, ſo called by many of our Anceſtors, who lived long before us.</p>

This Extraction may indeed be profitably uſed; but in a ſmall Doſe, and with great Caution. What happens in this Operation is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry admirable. For the Spirit of Wine abſtracted, can no more be united with the red Extraction, whence it was diſtilled; but one ſloats above the other, as Water and Oyl, which cannot be mixed. But if the abſtracted Spirit of Wine be poured upon other Liver of <hi>Antimony,</hi> it again attracts the Colour to it ſelf; yet this, although poured upon the former Extraction, cannot be mixed therewith. Which is a Thing ſo ſtrange, as it may be numbred among Wonders. But who can declare all the Wonders of <hi>GOD?</hi> or who will worthily eſteem the Gifts of the Creator, which he hath implanted in his Creatures? by us ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſcrutable with deep Meditation.</p>

            <p>For it repreſſeth all Symptoms of what kind ſo ever, ſuffereth none to take Root, and admits no Putrefaction in freſh Wounds.

            <p>I have often made mention of this Preparation in other of my Writings, alſo in this Treatiſe of <hi>Antimony,</hi> very largely; becauſe I know how great Benefits and how great Secrets are latent in it. Therefore I hope, no Diſciple will be affected with tediouſneſs, by Reaſon of Repetitions in my Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, which I faithfully open and bring to Light.

            <p>But I make too large a Progreſs in this open Field of Doctrine, in which the Ancient Hunters take their Larks, and the Young Ones preſently follow them with their Nets. For my Style (as all my Writings witneſs) hath a certain ſingular purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Method, like that of all Philoſopers before me. If any one think it ſtrange, that I here propoſe certain ſingular Proceſſes, in which my Philoſophy diſſers from other, let him be anſwered with this, rhat Philoſophick Speech much differs from the Method of other mens Diſcourſes, who nakedly and ſincerely declare ſome Proceſs, without any Ambiguities or Cloudings of <hi>Aenigma</hi>'s. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, conſider the difference, and accuſe not me,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:62975:66"/>as if I had deviated from Order, in my Style of Philoſophy, and of Preparations and Proceſſes. For in a Philoſophick Diſcourſe, it is behooful to learn and judge of what appertains to the Theory, but the Practice teacheth you the Inſtruction of Proceſſes; therefore in them, true, ſimple, clear and well grounded Words are to be uſed.</p>
            <p>Alſo, of <hi>Antimony</hi> is made a <hi>Balſom,</hi> againſt grievous Diſeaſes very profitable; yet not of Crude <hi>Antimony,</hi> but of the <hi>Regulus</hi> thereof, whence may be made living <hi>Mercury,</hi> in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing manner.</p>
            <p>Take of the beſt <hi>Hungarian Antimony,</hi> and crude<note n="*" place="margin">What I adviſed to in the Preparation of <hi>Liver</hi> of <hi>Antimony</hi> is here to be repeated; instead of Crude Tartar take Salt of Tartar, by which the Operation will ſooner and better proceed. Salnitre here is unprofitable. Therefore, take of <hi>Antimony</hi> and Salt of Tartar, of each equal parts, melt them and make a <hi>Regulus,</hi> according to the Rule here given by <hi>Baſilius.</hi> If you caſt away the Glaſs (as all men for the moſt part do) you will do ill. For I, of that prepare a very profitable Medicament in this manner. I grind this Glaſs in an hot Mortar, taking heed it contract no Humidity from the Air, which may eaſily be prevented, and having put it in a Phial, pour Alcohol of Wine thereon, and thence extract a moſt beautiful Tincture, in Colour red like Blood. This Tincture is a most excellent Cordial, if thirty, forty or fifty Drops of it be taken in convenient Liquor, and that, if you will, twice or thrice a day; for it is taken with ſafety, and recreates the whole Man.</note> Tartar equal parts, and of Salnitre half a part; grind them well together, and afterward flux them in a Wind-Fornace; pour out the flowing Matter into a Cone, and there let it cool; then you will find the <hi>Regulus,</hi> which thrice or oftner purge by Fire, with Tartar and Nitre, and it will be bright and white, ſhining like Cupellate Silver, which hath fulminated and overcome all its Lead.</p>
            <p>Grind this <hi>Regulus</hi> to a ſubtle Powder, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put it into a Glaſs, pour it on Oyl of Juniper, or Spirit of Turpentine, which comes forth in the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:62975:67"/>firſt Diſtillation, and is pure as Fountain Water; keep the Veſſel well cloſed, in a ſubtle heat of <hi>B. M.</hi> and the Oyl of Juniper, or Spirit of Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, will become red as Blood, which pour off, and rectifie with Spirit of Wine. This is endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſame Virtues, as Balſom of Sulphur, as I ſhall then ſhew, when I write of Sulphur, becauſe they require one and the ſame Preparation.</p>
            <p>Of this Balſom only three or four Drops, taken thrice in a Week with hot Wine, heal the Diſeaſes of the Lungs, cure the frequent Cough, and <hi>Aſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> alſo they are conducent in the <hi>Vertigo,</hi> prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Sides and in diuturnal Coughs.</p>
            <p>Alſo many Oyls may be prepared of <hi>Antimony,</hi> ſome <hi>per ſe</hi> and without Addition, and many others by Addition. Yet they are not endued with the ſame Virtues, but each enjoys its own, according to the Diverſity of its Preparation. Of which I now give you this Similitude. There are many kinds of Animals, which live only in the Earth, as are many Creeping Things, Worms and Serpents; alſo others, ſome of which are new kinds, which before were not, and theſe alſo proceed from Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction of the Earth. Some inhabit the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as all kinds of Fiſhes; others ſlie through the Air, as every kind of Flying Things, and Birds; ſome alſo are nouriſhed in the Fire, as the Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander. And beſides theſe, in the more hot Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions and Iſlands, are found many other Animals, which to theſe Nations are unknown, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long their Life by the Solar Heat, and which die ſo ſoon as brought into another Air. So <hi>Antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> when prepared by the Addition of Water, aſſumes another Nature and Complexion for ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating, then when prepared by Fire only. And although every Preparation of it ought to be made by Fire, without which the Virtue of it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:62975:67"/>not be manifeſted: yet conſider, that the Additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Earth gives it wholly another Nature, than the Addition of Water. So alſo when <hi>Antimony</hi> is ſublimed in Fire through the Air, and further prepared, another Virtue, other Powers, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Operation follow, than in the Preparations already deſcribed. Therefore the Oyl of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, per ſe,</hi> without addition, and the true Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur thereof are prepared after this Method.</p>
            <p>Take crude <hi>Hungarian Antimony,</hi> put that ground to a ſubtle Powder, into a Glaſs <hi>Cucurbit</hi> with a flat bottom: and pour thereon the true Vinegar of Philoſophers rendred more acid with its own Salt. Then ſet the <hi>Cucurbit</hi> firmly cloſed in Horſe-dung, or <hi>B. M.</hi> to putrefie the matter for forty Days, in which time the Body reſolves it ſelf, and the Vinegar contracts a Colour red as Blood. Pour off the Vinegar, and pour on freſh, and do this ſo often, as until the Vinegar can no more be tinged. This being done, filtre all the Vinegar through Paper, and again ſet it, put into a clean Glaſs firmly cloſed again in Horſe-dung, or <hi>B. M.</hi> as before, that it may putrefie for forty Days; in which time the Body again reſolves it ſelf, and the Matter in the Glaſs becomes as black as <hi>Calcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thum,</hi> or Shoomakers Ink. When you have this Sign, then true Solution is made, by which the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Separation of Elements is procured. Put this black matter into another Cucurbit, to which apply an Alembick, and diſtil off the Vinegar with moderate Fire; then the Vinegar paſſeth out clear, and in the bottom a ſordid matter remains; grind that to a ſubtle Powder, and edulcorate it with diſtilled Rain Water, then dry it with gentle heat, and put it a Circulatory with a long Neck (the Circulatory muſt have three Cavities or Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, as if three Globes were ſet one above another,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:62975:68"/>yet diſtinct or apart each from other, as Sublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories; with their Aludel [or Head] are wont to be made, and it muſt have a long Neck like a Phial, (or Bolthead and pour on it Spirit of Wine high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rectified, till it riſeth three Fingers above the Matter, and having well cloſed the Veſſel, ſet it in a moderate heat for two Months. Then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows another new Extraction, and the Spirit of Wine becomes tranſparently red as a Ruby, or as was the firſt Extraction of the Vinegar, yea more fair. Pour off the Spirit of Wine thus tinged, filtre it through Paper, and put it into a Cucurbit (the black Matter which remains ſet aſide, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from this Work; for it is not profitable therein) to which apply an Head and Receiver, and having firmly cloſed all Junctures, begin to diſtil in Aſhes with moderate Fire: then the Spirit of wine carries over the Tincture of <hi>Antimony</hi> with it ſelf, the Elements ſeparate themſelves each from other, and the Alembeck and Recipient ſeem to reſemble the form of pure Gold tranſparent in Aſpect. In the end ſome few Feces remain, and the Golden Colour in the Glaſs altogether fayls. The red Matter, which in diſtilling paſſed over into the Receiver, put into a Circulatory for ten Days, and as many Nights. By that Circulation Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is made; for the Oyl thereby acquires Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and ſeparates it ſelf to the bottom from the Spirit of Wine; and the Spirit of Wine is again Clear, as it was at firſt, and ſwims upon the Oyl. Which admirable Separation is like a Miracle in Nature: Separate this Oyl<note n="*" place="margin">Here you have not only whatſoever can be made of <hi>Antimony,</hi> but alſo almoſt all that can be promiſed by a <hi>Chymiſt.</hi> This is that with which all the Books of all <hi>Chymiſts</hi> are filled, which is involved in ſo many Fables, compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in ſo many Riddles, and explicated with ſo many obſcure Commentaries, that is, which in all the World is deſired by Fools, ſought by the Sons of Art, and ſound by the Wiſe.

            <pb n="111" facs="tcp:62975:68"/>
            <p>This Oyl is of a ſingular and incredible Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, with which no other thing may be compared, it is grateful in the Uſe, and all Corroſiveneſs is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from it. No man can by Cogitation judge, by Underſtanding comprehend, what incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible Effects, potent Powers, and profitable Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues are in this Royal Oyl. Therefore, to this <hi>Sulphur</hi> of <hi>Antimony,</hi> I have given no other Name, than my Balſom of Life; becauſe it effects very much, by the Grace of <hi>GOD,</hi> in thoſe, in whom was no help to be hoped for, but by the Mercy of <hi>GOD,</hi> and nothing remained but a moſt certain expectation of changing Life with Death; as my Brethren can witneſs hath been often done. It refreſheth a man ſo, as if he were new born; it purifies the Blood; mixt and exhibited with the Tincture of Corals, it cleanſeth the Leproſie, and expels every Scab, which through impurity of the Blood takes Root in man. It drives away Melancholy and ſadneſs of Heart, it confirms the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:62975:69"/>Junctures, and above all ſtrengthens the Heart, when given with the Magiſtery of Pearls. Alſo it helps the Memory, and in Swouning a more noble Medicine is not found, if ſix drops of it mixt with equal parts of Oyl of Cinnamon be put upon the Tongue, and the Noſtrils and Arteries be anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a little of the Eſſence of Saffron.</p>
            <p>Ah Good <hi>GOD,</hi> what moves me to ſpeak, write, and invent many Things! For I ſuppoſe I ſhall find few among the <hi>Doctors,</hi> who will give abſolute Credit to theſe my Writings, which I have declared faithfully, inſtead of a Teſtament, to my Diſciples, Apoſtles, and Followers; but Others, who before knew theſe wonderful Effects, and have often in Truth experienced theſe Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, will more accurately attend, and more eaſily believe, and for this bounty of mine (<hi>viz.</hi> becauſe I have opened, by the permiſſion of <hi>GOD,</hi> the Powers and Virtues which are infuſed in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and have as it were freed them from Priſon, brought them to Light, and unto free Operation) give me thanks, and ſpeak honourably of me, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I am reduced to Duſt in the Grave.</p>
            <p>Another way to drive <hi>Antimony,</hi> without Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, over by Alembeck is this.</p>
            <p>Make a <hi>Regulus</hi> of <hi>Antimony,</hi> by <hi>Tartar</hi> and <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitre,</hi> as I above taught, grind this ſubtily, put it in a great round Glaſs, and place it in a moderate heat of Sand. This way the <hi>Antimony</hi> will be ſublimed: whatſoever ſhall be ſublimed, that dayly put down with a Feather, that at length it may remain in the Bottom, and there perſiſt until nothing more of it can be ſublimed, but the whole remains fixed in the Bottom. Then is your <hi>Regulus</hi> fixed and precipitated <hi>per ſe.</hi> But conſider, here is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a ſufficient time, and reperition of the Labour often, before you can obtain. that. This Red Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:62975:69"/>take out, grind it to a ſubtle Powder, which ſpred upon a flat and clean Stone, ſet in a cold moiſt Place and there let it remain for ſix Months; at length the Precipitate begins to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve it ſelf into a red and pure Liquor, and the Feces or Earth is ſeparated from it. The Salt of <hi>Antimony,</hi> I ſay, only reſolves it ſelf into Liquor, which filter, and put into a Cucurbit, that it may be condenſed by extraction of the phlegm; and again ſet it in a moyſt place, then will it yield you fair Cryſtals. Separate theſe from their phlegm, and they will be pellucid, mixt wiith a red Colour; but when again purified become white. Then is made the true Salt<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>or like with like,</hi> is a Proverh among the Greeks, and is here manifeſt in our Chymical Work. For this Salt acuates all <hi>Menſtruum</hi>'s, for their more eaſie extraction of Metals; but thoſe Extractions moſt, which are made of <hi>Antimony,</hi> as of a Mineral to it of affinity and like.</note> of <hi>Antimony,</hi> as I have often prepared it.</p>
            <p>This Salt dry, and mix with it <hi>Venenian</hi> Earth (which is called <hi>Tripel</hi>) three Parts, and in ſtrong Fire diſtil it. Firſt a white Spirit comes off, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward a red Spirit, which alſo reſolves it ſelf into white. Rectifie this Spirit gently and ſubtily in a dry or moyſt <hi>Balneo,</hi> and ſo you will have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther white Oyl diſtilled from the Salt of <hi>Antimony.</hi> This Oyl, but why do I call it Oyl? this Spirit, I ſhould rather ſay, ſince the Salt is diſtilled in a Spiritual manner, in Quartans and other Feavers often manifeſts its Virtues, and is very conducent in breaking the Stone of the Bladder; it provokes Urine, and is profitable in the Gout. Outwardly applied to old corroſive Wounds, which have their Operation from <hi>Mars,</hi> it purifies them. Alſo, this Spirit of the Salt of <hi>Antimony</hi> purifies the whole Blood, as the Salt of Gold doth. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:62975:70"/>in healing very many other Diſeaſes it may be proſitably applied, yet it is not ſo perfect, as the above deſcribed red Oyl of <hi>Antimony,</hi> in which its Sulphur is deduced to the higheſt, puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and ſeparated, as I ſaid; therefore I forbear to ſpeak more of this.</p>
            <p>Now, ſince I have treated of the Sulphur and Salt of <hi>Antimony,</hi> and ſhewed how they may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced Medicine; I here treating further, purpoſe to ſpeak of its <hi>Mercury</hi> alſo, and to manifeſt what Medicine lies abſconded, and as it were buried in it.</p>
            <p>Take the <hi>Regulus</hi> of <hi>Antimony,</hi> made in ſuch manner, as I above taught, eight Parts. Salt of Humane Urine clarified and ſublimed, one Part. Sal-Armoniack one Part: and one Part of Salt of Tartar. Mix all the Salts together in a Glaſs, and having poured on ſtrong Wine-Vinegar, lute it with the Luting of Sapience, and digeſt the Salts with the Vinegar for an intire Moneth in conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Heat; afterward put all into a Cucurbit, and in Aſhes diſtil off the Vinegar, that the Salts may remain dry. Theſe dry Salts mix with three Parts of <hi>Venetian</hi> Earth, and by Retort diſtil the Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with ſtrong Fire, and you will have a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Spirit. This Spirit pour upon the aforeſaid <hi>Regulus</hi> of <hi>Antimony</hi> reduced to Powder, and ſet the whole in putrefaction for two Moneths. Then gently diſtil the Vinegar from it, and with what remains mix a fourfold weight of the filings of Steel, and with violent Fire diſtil by Retort: then, the Spirit of Salt, which paſſeth out, carries over with it ſelf the <hi>Mercury</hi> of <hi>Antimony</hi> in the Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of Fume. Wherefore in this Operation you muſt apply a great Recipient with a large quantity of Water in it, ſo doing, the Spirit of Salt will be

            <p>Behold, O Lover of Art, I have ſhewed you, how of <hi>Antimony</hi> may be made Running <hi>Mercury,</hi> which very many have ſo long, and in ſo many Parts of the World ſought; and how we may uſe this <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> with prayſe in Medicine, I will here diſcover and ſet down in Writing.</p>
            <p>Take in the Name of the Lord, of this <hi>Mercury</hi> one Part, expreſs it through a Skin, and pour on it of red Oyl of Vitriol highly rectified, four Parts: Extract the Oyl, and the Spirits of the Oyl will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main with the <hi>Mercury:</hi> Force it with vehement Pire, and ſomewhat will be ſublimed. This Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limate again put down upon the Earth in the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom. Then pour on other Oyl, of the ſame weight as before, and repeat this labour a third time. The fourth time, put the Sublimate which aſcends with the Earth, and grind both together, and the whole will be clear and pure, like a <hi>Speculum</hi> or Cryſtal. Put this into a Circulatory, and pour on it a like weight of Oyl of Vitriol, and thrice ſo much Spirit of Wine. Circulate until Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be made, and at length the <hi>Mercury</hi> reſolve it ſelf into Oyl, and float about like Oyl Olive. When you ſee this, ſeparate this Oyl from the other Liquor, and put it into a Circulatory, and there pour on ſtrong diſtilled Vinegar, and permit it ſo to reſt for about twenty Days. Then this Oyl again acquires its own Gravity, and ſettles to the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:62975:71"/>Bottom; and whatſoever Venenoſity was in it, remains in the Vinegar, which will be tenebrous and altogether confuſed.<note n="*" place="margin">There is no need of Torches at Noon Day, nor of Commentaries in ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous a Deſcription, by which <hi>Baſilius</hi> teacheth to make the <hi>Mercury</hi> of <hi>Antimony.</hi> Begin leiſurely, give heed to all particulars, and your Work ſhall never deceive you.

            <p>This is a great <hi>Arcanum,</hi> and ſeems repugnant to Nature, that this Oyl ſhould firſt ſwim, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward being rendred more ponderous, ſettle to the Bottom. But conſider, the Oyl of Vitriol is alſo heavy, yet when the <hi>Mercury</hi> in its Separation is not altogether pure, it ſtands above it; but when the impure Lightneſs is taken from it by Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar, becauſe the Vinegar aſſumes that, then the Oyl receives its juſt weight, becomes compact, and ſettles to the Bottom. This is the Oyl of the <hi>Mercury</hi> of <hi>Antimony,</hi> which is the fourth Column of Medicine.</p>
            <p>Now come hither you Lepers! where be you? I will ſupply you with Means for Health. This Oyl is proſitable againſt the Apoplexy, comforts the Brain, makes a man induſtrious, and cheriſheth the vital Spirits of the Head. If any one hath la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured long with grievous Diſeaſes, and will for
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:62975:71"/>ſome time dayly uſe this Oyl, his Hairs and Nayls will fall off, and he will be renovated, as a man new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born. All the Blood in the Humane Body is by it ſo purified, as every Evil is taken off from it, and expelled. This heals the <hi>French Diſeaſe,</hi> which we have lately inherited; for by this Medicine it is radically extirpated. And, to comprehend much in few words, the praiſe of this Oyl is greater in Medicine, than can be expreſſed by Speech or Writing.</p>
            <p>Why do we, miſerable Mortals, taken from the Earth, and ready to return into Earth, ſtick here? Why do we not haſten to give Thanks to <hi>GOD</hi> our <hi>Creator,</hi> for this Medicine ſo mercifully granted to Us? You <hi>Doctors</hi> (if it pleaſe the Gods) of either Medicine, come to me a religious man and Servant of <hi>GOD,</hi> I will manifeſt to you what your Eyes never ſaw, and will ſhew you the way of Health and Sanity, which before you never knew. Yet if any one be found among you, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands my Proceſſes, and the way of Preparation, better than I; let him, I pray, not be ſilent, or ſet a Seal to his Lips: for here I ſtand ready to learn, nor am I aſhamed further to inquire, and deſire that Light, which before I knew not. For I have often ſaid, that this our Life is circumſcribed with more ſtrait Limits, then that one man ſhould be able to ſearch out all Things, which Nature bears abſconded in her Boſom. But on the contrary, I being the Author, let them be ſilent, who have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced leſs than I, and if they have not attained to a ſolid Underſtanding of my Writings, let them not attempt to amend them, or (like Braw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers) with inconſiderate Words reprehend, what they never learned in the Schools, and the Proceſſes of which they never received from men skilled in the Law. For my Terms otherwiſe ſound, and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:62975:72"/>ſignifie other than theirs, who oppoſe themſelves againſt me, and who are aſhamed of the Labour of Planting Trees, and of Grafting fruitful Sprouts thereon; therefore they always abide among dry and withered Wild Trees, and can never attain to any Branch of green, ſappy, and well manured Fruit Trees.</p>
            <p>Haſten not, I ſay, O man experienced in our Art, to paſs your Sentence of Judging, and be not willing to condemn, what you have not yet your ſelf acquired by Thoughts, or gained by Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. Many imprudent men frequently ſay, Fiſhes are frozen in Waters; but theſe diſcover their own imprudence and want of Knowledge. For it will never be proved, that a Fiſh, even in the bittereſt Winter will ever be frozen in Waters, as long as the Ice of thoſe Waters is dayly broken by the diligence of Mortals. But the reaſon why Fiſhes dye, is becauſe, when the Ice is not opened, their reſpiration is hindred, and they thence are are ſuffocated. For it may eaſily be proved, that no Animal can live, when to it the uſe of Air is denied. Whence it may well be concluded, that thoſe Fiſhes, which are found dead under the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in an extream Cold Seaſon, die not of Cold (as men of little underſtanding think) but becauſe they are deprived of Air. By like Reaſon (that we may apply this Example) I ſay; ſince <hi>Antimony,</hi> is to produce ſuch admirable Fruits, it is to be taken out of the Mountains; but firſt, by the Care of the Miners ſpiracles, or breathing places, are to be made for it, and afterward it muſt be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with Water, Air and Fire, as with auxiliary Mediums, leſt its fruitfulneſs be ſuffocated in the Earth. But with many and laborious Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Artifice, it muſt be manifeſted and brought to Light, for the expected Sanation of Diſeaſes,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:62975:72"/>by reaſon of which it hath been ſo long ſought into.</p>
            <p>Where now, O Wretch! who contemneſt <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony,</hi> and among all men accuſeſt it as mere Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom, where is thy Rhetorick, or Dialect, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to defend thy ſelf? But ſince thou under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeſt neither White, nor Black, nor Green, nor Red, nor Yellow; nor knoweſt which way to go about to juſtifie <hi>Antimony,</hi> its Virtue, Power and Utility, being unknown to thee, thou doeſt well, if thou keepeſt Silence, and permitteſt this Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of thy Ignorance, as a Wave driven with vehement wind to fly over thy Head; fearing, that if thoſe Winds and Waves ſhould be predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, thy own weak and frail Bark would be ſunk and ſubmerged. To avoid this peril, ſeaſonably call upon thy Sleeping Maſter, as the Diſciples of our <hi>Saviour Jeſus Chriſt</hi> did, when they feared they ſhould periſh. Yet this muſt not be done with a diſſembled and feigned, but with a true and pure Heart, without all Hypocriſie; then your Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption and Help will undoubtedly follow, ſo that in all Verity you will ſee and find the Winds and the Sea to obey you, and all Things to be brought to the deſired End.</p>
            <p>I wiſh man were but ſo diſpoſed, as he would ſtudy to obtain ſomewhat with labour and Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, then certainly the Gods, the Preſidents of Proſperity and Art would give Succeſs, by which ſuch a Diſciple and Follower of Art might be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, that in the wiſhed School of Art, and deſired Domicil of Grace, Felicity and Health ſhould not be denied him, but that he himſelf ſhould certainly ſee and find the Foundation of the Corner Stone, upon which he might commodiouſly build up all the other Orders of Stones. Then would ceaſe the ſo many evilly founded Impertinencies of Bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, which in the Schools ſtun the Ears of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:62975:73"/>and in Houſes the Ears of the Sick; and the Maſter it ſelf would ſpeak, as it were with open Mouth, and by certain Experience confirm, that a Caſtle or Palace of Stone cannot ſo eaſily be ſet on Fire and burnt, as a Pidgeon-Houſe, or the old Neſt of a Stork compoſed of rotten Wood, and dayly dried more and more by the Sun.</p>
            <p>But my Auditor and Diſciple, do thou with ſharp Judgment weigh this my ſincere Information, and with fervent deſire ſtrive to penetrate the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Center of Art, which by the external Face can be known by no man; proſecute and preſs af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Virtue and Power thereof, no otherwiſe, than as a Hunter purſues a Wild Beaſt; ſearch out its Footſteps through the Snow, that you may rightly diſtinguiſh, and not take an Hart inſtead of an Hind, or an Hare inſtead of a Fox, or give a falſe eſtimate thereof, by erring from its Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps. Well, caſt out your Nets, and take a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Fiſhes, according to your own Wiſh or Deſire. Place your Threads as is behooful, and diſpoſe of the Birds, which allure others to their place, and by this way of Fowling you will fulfil your deſire with proſit. That by theſe, to every Searcher I may briefly propoſe my Admonition and Advice, I ſay: My Friend the Hunter, diſpoſe rightly your Nets and Inſtruments for Hunting as behoveth; and you Mariner, who Night and Day ſay through the vaſt Seas, and are often driven hither and thither by the Winds, give heed to the Point of your Compaſs, and undoubtedly you will reap proſit, and not bring home your Ship, ſwiftly returning, without great Gain of Merchandize.</p>
            <p>But why do I treat of many things, or ſpend time unproſitably (as tatling Sophiſters are wont to do) in beating out the empty Chaff? I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived;
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:62975:73"/>I do not unprofitably ſpend my time; for all the Words in my Writings are of uſe, and in them are found few empty Letters, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain not ſome Utility together with a profitable Inſtruction, ſo that the time I ſpend in Writing will rather be a Recreation, than a Burthen to me.

Now follow thoſe, that are in themſelves clear enough, and not of ſo great moment as the former; therefore we ſhall not inſiſt upon them.</note> is principally in Wounds, which have been a long time open, and in the Cure of which the <hi>Doctors</hi> with their Plaiſters, Unguents, Oyls and Ligaments could effect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:62975:74"/>but with very great Diſgrace they at length take off the Horſe's Bridle and Saddle, and return him to the Stable, whence they had him.</p>
            <p>My Form of Speaking Savours of Simplicity; for I am a man Religious, to whom the Method of Secular Men is unknown; therefore cannot ſo clearly detect and deſcribe all Things, as the Matter it ſelf ſeems to require. Such a man as I, as to the Terms, becauſe he cannot ſo formally uſe them, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to be pardoned in this, and if he neglect any thing therein, he craves the candid Acceptation of all men, and in reſpect of his State offers himſelf willing and ready to ſerve all <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Day and Night, and by his Prayers to <hi>GOD,</hi> to recompence this their Benevolence.</p>
            <p>This Oyl is ſalutary in many grievous Accidents, and eſpecially in old wounds, ſo that few Medicines are found, which muſt not give place to this. Only that Oyl, which is prepared with the Vulgar Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limate of Apothecaries, is equal unto it in Effects, and is oftentimes by Experience found to be better, eſpecially in the <hi>Wolf</hi> and <hi>Cancer,</hi> and in the <hi>Noli me tangere.</hi> But in ordinary Fiſtula's, and the <hi>Herpes</hi> the ſuperiour Oyl effects wonders, which were they not confirmed by Experience, could not be believed, and all which I recite not, leſt ſome
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:62975:74"/>one or other ſhould judge me to do it from Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or that thence I hunt after Fame, which was never by me either ſought or deſired; nor at this time, as I can holily affirm, is it aimed at by me.</p>
            <p>Now I will give you the Preparation of another Oyl.</p>
            <p>Take <hi>Mercury</hi> mortified (which is ſublimed to clearneſs and Splendor, and ſold by Apothecaries) and <hi>Antimony,</hi> of each equal parts. Grind them together, and diſtil them by ſuch a Retort, as will retain the Spirits thrice, and afterward rectifie this Oyl with Spirit of Wine. Then the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is abſolved, and the Oyl becomes red as Blood; but at firſt it is White, and like Ice or congealed Butter. This Oyl effects wonders in many Affects, where Nature gave no hope of Amendment, and it always moſtly ſhews its force, virtue, power, and efficacy, in the perfect Emendation of Evil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Good.</p>
            <p>By Addition may be prepared another Oyl ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry profitable in external Wounds.</p>
            <p>Take of <hi>Antimony</hi> one part, <hi>Sulphur</hi> one part, <hi>Sal-Armoniack,</hi> or Salt of Urine purified half a part, and <hi>Calx-Vive</hi> two parts. Expel the Oyl ſtrongly: whatſoever is ſublimed, that grind with the <hi>Caput-mortuum,</hi> and thereon again pour the Oyl diſtilled off, and thrice diſtil it; then the Oyl is prepared.</p>
            <p>When old Wounds can in no wiſe be healed, then uſe this Oyl. For it is ſtrong, potent and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrative: and lays a good Ground (even as Oyl of Vitriol doth) for future Sanation.</p>
            <p>An admirable Balſom of divers Ingredients (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which is <hi>Antimony</hi>) very uſeful in old Wounds, is thus prepared.</p>
            <p>Take of <hi>Sulphur</hi> ℥iiij. ſet it over a moderate Fire to melt, and put into it half a pound of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:62975:75"/>and ſtir the Mixture ſo long together, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til both become one Maſs. This Maſs grind to Powder (for it is made as <hi>Cinnabar</hi> is wont to be prepared) then grind with it ℥iiij. of <hi>Antimony,</hi> of red <hi>Arſenick</hi> ℥iiij. of <hi>Crocus Martis</hi> ℥ij. and of Powder of Tiles ℥viij. Put all theſe into a Glaſs Cucurbit, and ſublime them, as ſuch things are wont to be ſublimed; and in this Sublimation you will have Rubies in Colour not inferiour to the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ental, but they are not fixed; for they are volatile, and fly from the Fire. Let the Artificer ſeparate theſe Rubies from the Cinnabar, which aſcends in the Sublimation, grind them to Powder and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract them with ſtrong Vinegar. This being done. let him abſtract the Vinegar leaſurely in <hi>B. M.</hi> and a Powder will remain; this Powder grind ſmall as before, and having put it into another Glaſs, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract its Tincture with Spirit of Wine, and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the remaining Feces. This Extraction with Spirit of Wine digeſt in <hi>B. M.</hi> well cloſed for one Month. Then abſtract the Spirit of Wine, as you abſtracted the Vinegar, and put the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Powder of Wine into a flat Glaſs Diſh, and ſet that Diſh in a Cellar into a Pail full of Water, that it may Swim upon the Water, as a Boat. So do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. the Powder which is in the Glaſs will in a few days reſolve it ſelf into a clear and perlucid Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor.</p>
            <p>This Liquor is ſalutary in old open Wounds, and is a vulnerary Balſom in like Accidents, if put into them, and they covered round with a common Stiptick Plaiſter. In diuturnal open Wounds, it leaves no man deſtitute of help, although ſuch, as in the Cure of which all other Remedies have been tried in vain. Of open Ulcers, which have their Original from within, I ſpeak not here; for they cannot perfectly be healed without internal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:62975:75"/>which drye up all Fluxions, and radically extirpate the Diſeaſe: although at this time few are found, who bend their thoughts this way, or take any Courſe to touch the Root it ſelf of thoſe Diſeaſes, of which I now treat.</p>
            <p>If Men would in their Minds well conſider the Calamities of Life, into which the Fall of our firſt Parents precipited us, and ſeriouſly weigh that O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal Sin, and the great troop of Evills thence iſſuing, <hi>Viz:</hi> of Sadneſs, Anguiſh, Diſeaſes and Miſeries, they certainly would ſpend their time better, and imploy more labour to ſearch out the health of their neighbours, ſo ſtrictly commended to them by the Supream Ruler of Heaven, and by him commanded as their proper Duty. But how many (with grief be it ſpoken!) ſhunning labour, conſume their time unprofitably, and do not what was to be done by them, but what they formerly have done, and ſtill have a luſt to do, being affrayd to do ſo much, as will ſoyl their Fingers Ends; as if they did envy the Tradeſman, who perhaps gets a ſmall Gain by ſelling Soap, which they would not willingly buy, to waſh their delicate hands. Are not all we miſerable Mortals, that live here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in the Earth, poſſeſſing nothing, that we can call ours? Are not all Things we here uſe, the Goods of our <hi>Lord,</hi> lent to us, whilſt we live and no longer? Therefore we ought ſo to behave our Selves in uſing them, that ſupported with a good Conſcience we may be able to ſtand in that Day, in which an Account is to be given for them; and be not for our Ingratitude caſt into Priſon, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Darkneſs where ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of Teeth. If this were the Meditation, and this the Intention of every Man, he would be like a Monſter, if he ſhould think of admitting Sin in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or of neglecting his Office; and all Men
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:62975:76"/>would, with a certain Emulation ſtrive to pleaſure their Neighbours, with the Gifts received from <hi>GOD.</hi> But theſe things are remote from the thoughts of the World, and Wordly Men; <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, Money,</hi> is the Scope of all their Intentions; this the Potent ſeek directly or indirectly, and for this the Poor are ſubſervient to them, that they alſo may participate of the Mammon of Iniquity.</p>
            <p>Yet take heed, I adviſe you to take heed, leſt the Bones of that Fleſh, ſticking in your Throat, Suffocate you, or the Back-bones of Fiſhes pierce your Heart. But what doth Admonition help which the World little eſteemes of and derides? Hear, I pray you an Hiſtory; or learn a Parable. When I, according to my Vow, undertook a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage to St. <hi>James,</hi> to viſit that holy Place as a Stranger, I prayed to <hi>GOD,</hi> and bound myſelf with a Vow, that if the granted me an happy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to my Monaſtery, I would render him due Prayers. He granted my Requeſt, and I daily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn Thanks to him. But I thought many more would have rejoyced with me, and have given thanks to the ſame <hi>GOD,</hi> for the famous Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques, which at that time I brought with me to our Monaſtery, (for Conſolation of the Poor, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Others) that it might procure to it ſelf a Name, in this periſhing Valley of Tears, that could not bee wiped out by any Oblivion. Yet hence few were rendred either better, or more grateful to <hi>GOD,</hi> for ſo great a benefit; but perſevered in Deriſion and Contempt of that, which <hi>GOD</hi> will vindicate in the laſt Day.</p>
            <p>But of theſe enough at this time, let us proceed in our Inſtruction of <hi>Antimony,</hi> whence yet another Medicine may be prepared, which I my ſelf have experienced to be very ſalutary; and effectual in every kind of Feavers, and in the Peſtilence.</p>
            <pb n="127" facs="tcp:62975:76"/>
            <p>Grind <hi>Antimony</hi> ſubtily, put it into a Glaſs Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort, and diſtil it with a ſtrong fire, without any Addition, 3. or 4. times, and alwayes with a large Receiving Veſſel; at length of it is made a Red Pouder, which extract with Vinegar, and circulate the Extraction with a gentle fire for ten whole Dayes; abſtract the Vinegar by Diſtilling, and that which remains, by a ſingular<note n="*" place="margin">This Extaction may be rendred volatile with Spirit of Wine, after the ſam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> manner, as I taught yuu in the former Operations.</note> Artifice in diſtilling will be changed into an Oyl. Let this Oyl be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Circulated until all Humidity be drawn off therefrom, and it again be reduced to Pouder, as it was; when the Vinegar is abſtracted and ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Diſtillation, then gather the Oyl in a new Receiver.</p>
            <p>Four Grains of this Oyl taken with water of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duus Benedictas,</hi> if the Sick be well covered and Sweated, heal <hi>Quotidian, Tertian &amp; Quartan</hi> Fevers. The ſame Doſe is very available for expelling the Peſt, either given with Spirit of Wine, or with diſtilled Vinegar, according as the <hi>Paroxyſm</hi> of the Peſt firſt invades, either with Heat, or with Cold. Which is witneſſed by three Brethren in our Monaſtery, who recovered of the Plague by this Arcanum, when they expected no other but Death, and had made their Wills. This ſo reconciled their Minds to this my Art, as they helped me, with greater Zeal then before, both by their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Labour, and ſpent the leiſure time they had exempt from Religious Dutyes, in ſerving me day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and in a ſhort time attained to ſo great Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that by their own Induſtry, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry of their Brethren, they gained more true Knowledge in ſearching out the Arcanums of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:62975:77" rendition="simple:additions"/>then they could before obtain in alonger <hi>ſeries</hi> of time. Therefore, for theſe Men, I give them thanks, even unto my very old Age; and in very deed I return them thanks, becauſe they deſerved ſo well of me, and of others, by their ſo faithful Labour; but they finiſhed their Courſe of this Life before me, and entred the way of all Fleſh, wherefore I recommend their Reward to the Supreme Phyſitian, who dwells in the higheſt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and there will refreſh them with ſufficient Joy, and make up in Heaven that Juſt Recompence, which here on Earth was denyed them by ignorant, and ungrateful Men.</p>
            <p>Another Oyl of <hi>Antimony</hi> for wounds, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with Addition in the following Manner.</p>
            <p>Take of <hi>Antimony, Sulphur, Saltnitre,</hi> of each e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual parts; Fulminate thoſe under a Bell, as Oyl of <hi>Sulphur per Campan.</hi> is made; which way of prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring hath long ſince been known to the Antients.

But ſince in other Preparations of <hi>Antimony,</hi> I have deſcribed ſuch Virtues, as with this are common to them, I Judge it needleſs to repeat them all, leſt in the Sectators of Art I ſhould create tediouſneſs through multiplicity of Words. or alien thoughts by an impertinent Tantolooy.</p>
            <p>In the mean while, the Liquor, which, as I above ſaid, was reſolved in an Humid Place, is an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Medicine, and very profitable; for it cleanſeth
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:62975:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Impurities of the Skin, and if a little Oyl of Tartar be mixed therewith, it heals the Phagede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na of the Fingers; and if often anointed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, it puriſyes the Skin and cures Scrophulaes.</p>
            <p>Alſo, Sulphur of <hi>Antimony</hi> is prepared in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Manner.</p>
            <p>Grind <hi>Antimony</hi> to a fine Pouder, which boyl for two hours or a little longer, in a ſharp Lixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vium made of the Aſhes of Beech-wood. When boyled, filter the <hi>Antimony</hi> clear, and poor Vinegar upon the filtred Liquor, and then the Sulphur will ſettle to the bottom wholly red. Pour off the Phlegm and gently dry the Pouder. Diſtil this Pouder with the Vinegar of Wine; extract the Tincture, and do as you did with the former Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur. To reduce the ſame into an Oyl by Diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, is worth your while: Although the Oyl above mentioned hath greater Virtues, becauſe its Body, by the Sal Armoniack, in the beginning of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limation was better diſſolved and opened.</p>
            <p>There yet remain many things to be written of <hi>Antimony,</hi> and eſpecially Three, neceſſary to be known by the <hi>Spagyrick</hi> Phyſitian and Philoſopher, <hi>viz.</hi> the Preparation of Vinegar, which is made of its Minera; and then the Philoſophick Signate Star, which is not to be omitted; and laſtly the Lead of Philoſophers, of which we ſhall ſpeak ſomewhat; touching which Many have imagined Great Things, and thought (in their way of Reaſoning, and Speculation) to prepare the true and ſyncere Mercury of Philoſophers of it; which indeed can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be done, ſince ſo great Efficacy is not from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove inſited in <hi>Antimony,</hi> as that in it can exiſt that Mercury, or of it be prepared.

When you have obtained this Acid Vinegar, take freſh Minera as before and pour this Vinegar on it, ſo as it may ſtand above it three Fingers; put it into a Pelican, and digeſt it two dayes in Heat, then the Vinegar becomes red, and much more ſharp then before. Cant this clean off, and diſtil it without Addition in <hi>B. M.</hi> The Vinegar comes off white, and the Redneſs remains in the Bottom, which extracted with Spirit of Wine is an excellent Medicine. Again rectify the Vinegar in <hi>B. M.</hi> that it may be freed from its Phlegm; laſtly diſſolve in it its proper Salt, <hi>viz:</hi> in ℥iiij. of it, ℥j. of the Salt, and force it ſtrongly by Aſhes; then the<note n="*" place="margin">This Vinegar alſo is numbred among the chief of thoſe things, which are prepared of <hi>Antimony,</hi> therefore I thought it worth while to illuſtrate this with ſome Commentaries. For although it may be made in the way <hi>Baſilius</hi> preſcribes, yet there are still ſome things wanting to render the Work both more eaſy and more perfect, which I here ſubjoyn; For ſix pounds of <hi>Antimony</hi> are required ſixteen pounds of Distilled Water, and when (after Digeſtion) we would distil it, a certain manual Operation muſt be obſerved, on which depends the Succeſs of the whole Work almoſt. For the Alembeck muſt be ſo placed, as his Pipe or Beak may be covered with Water, which either muſt be put into the Recipient, or paſs out by diſtilling into the ſame; otherwiſe the Spirit's of the <hi>Antimony</hi> will be loſt, and more then half part of the ſame periſh, or the Work require much more time for its perfection. I have expreſſed this by a Figure here placed; that if any by hearing do not ſufficiently perceive this, they may by ſeeing underſtand. When the whole Water hath paſſed over by Alembeck, the Fire (as the Author admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth) is to be increſed, and three Dayes, and as many Nights continued with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out intermiſſion. Then let all cool, and the Sublimate, as he teaches, muſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain be mixed with the <hi>Antimony;</hi> this Labour for three Dayes and Nights must be re-aſſumed, and afterward repeated to the third time. Then your Water will be acid, as common Vinggar. If you tinge this Vinegar with now <hi>Minera</hi> of <hi>Antimony,</hi> you will have a Tincture, which <hi>Baſilius</hi> names this Balſome of Life, ſo often deſcribed, but never ſufficiently commended. O, did Mortals know what Myſteries lye abſconded in this Tincture, I queſtion whether they would be deſirous to ſet about any other Preparation of <hi>Antimony.</hi> All things are in this One. I have ſpoken, O Lover of Chymiſtry, do thou act.</note> Vinegar becomes more ſharp, and acquires greater Strength, and virtue.</p>

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:62975:82" rendition="simple:additions"/>of Error, But I ſyncerely denounce, that it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo. For theſe kind of Searchers erre from the Kings high-way, and kill themſelves in clambering up Rocks and Cliffs, in which wild Goats inhabit, and Birds of Prey build their neſts.

Yet I affirm, that in it lyes <hi>abſconded</hi> a famous Medicine, which may be made of it. The Star is thus made.</p>
            <p>Take of <hi>Hungarian Antimony</hi> 3. parts: Of Steel 1. part. melt theſe together with 4. parts of burnt <hi>Tartar,</hi> when melted pour out the whole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Cone, when cold take out the Regulus, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate it from all impurity, and the Scoria.

Note, when you have rightly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated the Fuſion, and have uſed a manual Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as is fit (which is of principal concern in this Work) you will obtain a fair Star<note n="*" place="margin">Here it is to be noted. In the third fuſion of the Regulus, the Fire muſt be vehemently heightned, that if any Impurity remain with the Regulus, it may by that intenſe heat be taken away.

            <p>This Oyl may commodiouſly and ſecurely be taken inwardly; but with great Prudence and Caution, and not oftner then twice or thrice in a Week, and no more at one time, then three Drops in ℥ij. of Wine, or other Water diſtilled from Herbs, according to the Exigency of the Diſeaſe. For this Reaſon, it is the Phyſitians part to know the Cauſes of Diſeaſes, together with the Complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of the Sick, that he may the more ſecurely uſe his Remedies.</p>
            <p>This is a famous <hi>Acrimony</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">They, who understand of how great Utility it is to extract the Eſſences from Metals, are not ignorant of the Virtues of this ſharp Oyl. For this is the only <hi>Menſtruum</hi> for this purpoſe. How many are they who have ſpent their whole Life in Chymical Operations, and never could arrive to the knowledge of a true <hi>Menſtruum?</hi> To thee it is here revealed, if Health be your aim, you may ſafely uſe it in the Body; if you attempt ſomewhat more ſublime, and have already conceived good hope you ſhall compound it, this is the principal help of all, for aſcending to the Throne of the Chymical Kingdom.</note> containing in it ſelf many <hi>Arcanums;</hi> but there is no need to reveal all things together and at once to unskillful men. Some Arts are to be ſuppreſſed, that ſome Secrets and <hi>Arcanums</hi> may remain proper to the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:62975:83"/>who in ſearching them out hath daily ſuſtained grievous Toyl.</p>
            <p>But let him, who reſolves to tread in my Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps not be weary of Searching; but what I have done, let him do, and what I have ſo often deſired, and what with ſo earneſt Wiſhes I have ſought, let him ſeek. Theſe Principles, which I have preſcribed you, are ſufficient for to ſearch out the End by. Many have failed, yea many have been cut off by Death, before they could in their Learning attain to the Principles only; that is, they were deprived of Life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could acquire the Magiſtery of Art. Therefore, I at firſt ſet forth a Book of Rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that the Studious follower of Art (who in his firſt Experiences had need of ſo much time) might the ſooner attain his deſired end, and wiſhed Scope, and next unto <hi>GOD</hi> give me thanks.</p>
            <p>Moreover, in this Oyl a wonderful Effect is latent. For if this Oyl be circulated with Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtals for ſome time, <hi>viz.</hi> for three Days and Nights (the Cryſtals being firſt Calcined) it from them extracts a Salt: which being done, the Oyl may again be diſtilled off by Retort. Thus you will have a Medicine, which admirably breaks the Stone in the Bladder, and expels it, and alſo
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:62975:84"/>effects many other Things, by a certain famous vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in it.</p>
            <p>But that we may alſo ſay ſomething of the Lead of Philoſophers, let the curious ſearchers of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture know, that between <hi>Antimony</hi> and common Lead, there is a certain near affinity, and they hold a ſtrict friendſhip each with other. As a Tree caſts out of it's ſide it's ſuperfluous Roſin, which is the Sulphur of that Tree; as the Cherry-tree, and other Trees, which give forth ſuch Gums: there are other kinds of Trees alſo, which by reaſon of their abundance of <hi>Mercury,</hi> produce and caſt forth from themſelves a certain Excreſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, which neither in Form, nor Virtue is in any wiſe like to their Fruit; but hath wholy other properties, as in Oaks and Apple-trees is apparent, which produce like baſtard Fruits, or Monſters: So the Earth alſo hath like abortive Fruits, which in Separation from the pure Metals, are ſevered and caſt out.</p>
            <p>Now, although there is ſo ſtrict an affinity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Antimony,</hi> and <hi>Saturn;</hi> yet by reaſon of the too much <hi>Sulphur,</hi> which <hi>Antimony</hi> hath in it ſelf, it is caſt out from it: becauſe its viſcous Body (in it's Nativity) could not come to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; and therefore it was conſtrained neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to conſiſt among Minerals: becauſe it's abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of hot <hi>Sulphur</hi> was the Cauſe, that hindred it's <hi>Mercury,</hi> that through defect of Cold it could neither come to Coagulation, nor into a Malleable Body. Moreover, I ſay, the Lead in <hi>Antimony</hi> is no other, then it's Regulus, which hath not as yet obtained Malleableneſs. And, as above I ſaid, when the Regulus and Steel by Liquefaction are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and deduced to a Star, there are many, who would thence make the antient ſtone of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers; which I before denyed to be poſſible. Yet
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:62975:84"/>what Medicines may be prepared of it, you have already briefly heard; therefore touching them, I ſhall not add a Word more.</p>
            <p>But the Reaſon, why the Regulus is called and accounted Lead, is this. When that Regulus is taken, which <hi>Antimony</hi> gives forth from it ſelf in making Glaſs, and put into a Crucible well cloſed, which can reſiſt the fire, with the Salt of <hi>Saturn</hi> (having been firſt Cemented with the Salt for three hours) and theſe permitted to melt together, in a Wind Fornace, the<note n="*" place="margin">I not enviouſly, as many Chymists do, but affectionately deal with Chirurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: wiſhing that they would in their mind, as according to their faculty they may and ought, endeavor to prepare ſuch helps, for their miſerably afflicted Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, and ſuch Compendiums of Sanity, as may be prepared of this <hi>Regulus.</hi> Would you, have me diſcover to you the Myſtery?

                  </gap> with pleaſure, and uſe it. This <hi>Regulus,</hi> by the Salt of <hi>Saturn</hi> rendred Malleable, muſt be mixed with equal parts of <hi>Mercury</hi> condenſed by <hi>Saturn,</hi> and in a vehement fire fluxed, and ſo well mixed. The Matter comes forth, in it's external Face like unto Silver, but in its internal Virtues is more noble, and more pretious then any Silver. But you Chyrurgeon; ſtudious of your own Art, and by Art covetous of Glory, deduce that into thin Plates, and externally apply it to Wounds, and Malignane Fiſtula's. So doing, you will be amazed, when you ſhall ſee Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, helped by this Art, to perform more, in a very ſhort time, then you could have hoped for in a longer time, by ſo many unguents and Plaiſters. The Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks (to uſe the Words of <hi>Baſilius</hi>) will no more deride and upbraid you, ſaying, they can effect more with a piece of crude and ſtinking Lard, then you are able to do with the laborious Proceſs of your whole Chirurgick Art.</note> Regulus, when taken out, is found to be rendred ſoft, and more ponderous, then it was before. For it receives it's ponderoſity from the Spirit of the Salt, which alſo gave it ſoftneſs, ſo that it's Body now is compact and heavy.</p>
            <p>Therefore I ſay, there is not much difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Signate Star, and Lead of <hi>Antimony;</hi> which notwithſtanding are every where diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed as two divers things. For either of them is made of the Glaſs of <hi>Antimony,</hi> and prepared in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:62975:85"/>to one and the ſame Medicine, as is already by me ſufficiently declared. Here therefore I break off my Diſcourſe, that I may explain what the ſtone of fire is, after I ſhall have declared the Appendix which follows.</p>
            <p>O <hi>GOD grant thy Grace, and open the Hearts and Ears of Men unwilling to hear, and to them impart thy Bleſſing, that they may acknowledge Thee in thy Omnipotency, and wonderful Works of Nature, to thy Praiſe, Honor and Glory, and for the Health, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, and Confirmation of the Strength of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, and alſo for Reſtoring the Sick to their priſtine Health.</hi> Amen.</p>

Likewiſe Images of Men, and many other Things<note n="*" place="margin">The Virtues and powers of <hi>Antimony</hi> which the Author here in this Appendix ſo lightly toucheth, and paſſeth over, are ſo many and ſo various, as indeed the hundredth part of them is not yet known to Men. Which Ignorance undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly redounds to the Reproach und Ignominy of our kind; becauſe We Men, among ſo many other Animals, only endued with Reaſon, and a Faculty of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing, are hurryed with ſo great impetuouſneſs, to that wicked and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Deſire of Gain, as ſcarcely any Man hath leiſure to ſearch out the Wonders, which the Author of Nature hath inſited in his Creatures.

<p>Yet what I think of Characters and Signatures, which the Author ſaith may be made under a Concourſe of certain Conſtellations, I ſhall not here diſcover.

            <head>OF THE Triumphant Chariot OF ANTIMONY, AND What the STONE of FIRE is.</head>
            <p>WHen, at a certain time an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Thoughts (which my internal and fervent Prayer to <hi>GOD</hi> ſuggeſted) had ſet me looſe and wholy free from all terrene Buſineſſes, I purpoſed in my ſelf to attend to Spiritual Inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of which we have need, for the more accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſcrutiny of Nature. Therefore I reſolved to make my ſelf Wings, that I might aſcend on high, and inſpect the ſtars<note n="*" place="margin">This Leave is to be given to all, who treat of Sacred Things, <hi>Viz.</hi> to declare thoſe Things, which they are willing to diſcover (not to the unlearned igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Deriders, but only to Men, worthy, and to ſuch as ſincerely deſire, and aſpire to the knowledge of the ſame) in a certain ſingular and Parabolical kind of Writing. In which our Author is the more to be excuſed, becauſe when he comes to the greateſt of Mysteries, which he intended to explain in this Book, he betakes himſelf to certain hiding Places of Parables, and with the Heaven of Piety, which is wont to cover all things (yea even the moſt wicked) he ſo veils his Secrets, as None but Pious and ſincere Diſciples of Art can with the acuteneſs of their ſight penetrate theſe Clouds. do thou therefore,

            <pb n="144" facs="tcp:62975:87"/>
            <p>But when I ſoared too near the Sun, my Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with it's vehement heat were conſumed, and burnt, I fell headlong into the depth of the Sea: yet to me, in this my extream Neceſſity invoking <hi>GOD,</hi> help was ſent from Heaven, which freed me from all peril and the preſent Deſtruction. For an Angel haſtned to my aſſiſtance, who commanded the Waters they ſhould be ſtill, and inſtantly, in that deep Abyſs appeared a moſt high Mountain, upon which at length I aſcended, that I might thereon examine, whether (as Men had affirmed) there was any Friendſhip<note n="*" place="margin">There hath been no Man, who had darted his ſight but as it were through a Lattice, into the Penetrals of Chymiſtry, who did ever deny this Influence of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors upon Inſeriors. Therefore let <hi>Baſilius</hi> ſo holily affirming, and ſo often openly declaring it to Men, be credited by thoſe, who, the true Light being not yet riſen upon them, do by feeling without ſight practice Chymiſtry.</note> and Familiarity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Superiors and Inferiors, and whether the Superior Stars have acquired power from <hi>GOD,</hi> their Creator, to produce any one Thing like themſelves in the Earth.</p>
            <p>And having ſearched into Things, I found, that whatſoever the Ancient Maſters had ſo many Ages ſince committed to Writing, and delivered to their Diſciples, who earneſtly deſired to be the true
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:62975:87"/>Imitators of them, was (as I may ſay) more true than Truth it ſelf. Wherefore, as is fit, I give prayſe and thanks to my <hi>Lord</hi> and Heavenly Father, for his incomprehenſible Works.</p>
            <p>In very deed (that I may expound the matter in few Words) I found all Things, which are genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Bowels of Mountains, to be infuſed from the Superior Stars, and take their beginning from them, in the form of an <hi>aqueous</hi> Cloud, Fume or Vapour, which for a very long time fed and nouriſhed by the Stars, is at length educted to a tangible form by the Elements. Moreover, this Vapor is dryed, that the Watrineſs may loſe its Dominion, and the Fire next, by help of the Air, retain the Ruling Power. Of Water Fire, and of Fire and Air Earth is produced: which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding are found in all things conſiſting of body, before the Separation of them. Therefore this, <hi>viz.</hi> Water is the firſt Matter<note n="*" place="margin">This is an old Song, this is the Sum of Art; from this Imitation of Nature is found the leſſer Stone of Fire, from this it is made, Whenſoever it is prepared, from the Same alſo the great Philoſophick Stone derives its Original. This is the Water of <hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> the Fire of <hi>Empedocles,</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle's</hi> first Matter, of which all things have been, and to this Day are made. Which is clearly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the Nutrition of Man, the Growth of a Tree, and in the Generation of Metalls, For that, which conſtitutes Fleſh, Woods, and Metalls, is not taken from Food, Rain or Earth, but is infuſed into them from elſwhere. That very Thing is the Aliment, which nouriſheth all things, but that it may be ſo variouſly ſpecificate, it muſt be ſeparated from that Body, in which it dwells, and be joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to another, which by the Chymical Art is performed.</note> of all things, which by the Dryneſs of Fire and Air is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med into Earth.</p>
            <p>But now ſince my Intention is to deſcribe the Stone of Fire, how it is made of <hi>Antimony,</hi> together with the Proceſs of its Preparation, which not only heals Men, but Metalls alſo particularly; it will be neceſſary before all Things, to ſpeak ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:62975:88"/>of theſe following Heads. What properly the Stone of Fire is; what is its Minera; whether a Stone can be made without Matter or no; what is the extreme difference of Stones, and how many Species of them are found, and laſtly of their uſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In this my purpoſe, I pray, O Spirit of Heaven illuminate me, that I may give a true and ſyncere Inſtruction,</hi> viz. <hi>according as is fit for me, and the matter it ſelf permits. Indeed I have hopes of Eternal Abſolution from this my Supream confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, who from Eternity poſſeſſeth the Throne of Mercy, and will give Teſtimony of all Things, when the Decretory Sentence ſhall be pronounced upon all Men, in the laſt Judgement, without any appeal.</hi>

            <p>Therefore firſt know and conſider, that the True Tincture of <hi>Antimony,</hi> which is the Medicine of Men and Metalls, is not made of crude and mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Antimony,</hi> as it is ſold by Merchants and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries; but extracted from the Minera, as it is taken out of the Mountains, and before it is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med into Glaſs. But how that Extraction ſhould be made, is the principal Work in which the whole Art conſiſts: Health and Riches attend him, who rightly attains to that. But, my Reader, you muſt diligently mind this, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Tincture of <hi>Antimony</hi> prepared fixed and ſolid, or the Stone of Fire (as I name it is a certain pure, penetrative ſpiritual and fiery Eſſence, which is reduced into a coagulated Matter, like the Salamander, which in Fire is not conſumed, but purified and conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>

To this no ſuch power is given, as that it ſhould perform ſuch things, but it tingeth particularly; <hi>viz,</hi> Silver into Gold, Tin
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:62975:88"/>alſo and Lead; but <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> it toucheth not, nor do they yield more, then from them by Separation may be effected.</p>
            <p>Moreover, one part of it can tinge no more, then five parts of Metall, ſo as to perſiſt in the Tryal of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Antimony;</hi> whereas, on the contrary, the Great Stone of Philoſophers can tranſmute to infinity. Alſo in augmentation it cannot be ſo far exalted; yet the Gold is pure and ſolid.</p>
            <p>The Minera, out of which this Stone or Tincture is made, is no other then (as I above mentioned) the very Earth of <hi>Antimony;</hi> from which, I ſay, it is made: but how or with what virtue, force, and power it is endued, you ſhall hear anon.</p>
            <p>Let the Reader conſider, that there are many kinds of Stones found, which tinge particularly; but all fixed Pouders, which tinge, I here ſignify by the name of Stones; yet one tingeth more highly then another, as eſpecially the Stone of Philoſophers, which obtains the principal place; the next is the Tincture of <hi>Sol;</hi> and of <hi>Luna,</hi> &amp;c. For the White: after theſe, the Tincture of <hi>Vitriol</hi> or <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus;</hi> likewiſe the Tincture of <hi>Mars;</hi> either of which hath in it ſelf the Tincture of <hi>Sol,</hi> when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to Fixation. Next to theſe follow the Tinctures of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Saturn</hi> for Coagulation of <hi>Mercury;</hi> and laſtly, the Tincture of <hi>Mercury</hi> it ſelf. This is the difference and multiplicity of Stones and Tinctures, all which notwithſtanding
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:62975:89"/>are generated from Seed, and from one original <hi>Matrix,</hi> from which the true Univerſal Stone pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, but out of theſe no other Metallick Tincture is to be found. But all other Things, by what name ſoever called, all Stones (whether pretious or common) I touch not now, nor have I any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to write or ſpeak any thing of them at this time; becauſe they contain in themſelves no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Virtues, then what appertain to Medicine. Nor ſhall I here make mention of <hi>Animal</hi> or <hi>Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table</hi> Stones; becauſe they are only conducent to Medicine; but for Metallick Works unprofitable and voyd of all Virtue. Yet all the Virtues of all Things, <hi>Mineral, Animal</hi> and <hi>Vegetable,</hi> collected into one, are found in the Stone of Philoſophers.</p>
            <p>Salts are endued with no tinging Virtue, but are onely Keys<note n="*" place="margin">Salts, as here is rightly ſaid, are Keyes; they open the Cheſt wherein the Treaſure lyes. But you muſt be ſure to take the true Key; otherwiſe you may ſpoyl the Lock, and not open the Cheſt. It is not ſafe in this Caſe to take <hi>Quid</hi> for <hi>Quo,</hi> as Apothecaries are wont. You muſt have a Philoſophick Key and proper Salts fit for opening muſt be taken. Nor contemn that Diſtinction, which is intimated, between Salts opening, which the Author here calls (as they are) Keys, and Salts fixing, which enter the Treaſure it ſelf; as is ſufficiently manifeſt by the Text.</note> for the Preparation of Stones; otherwiſe of themſelves they effect nothing.</p>
            <p>Yet, as for Metallick Salts (I now ſpeak to the purpoſe if you rightly underſtand, what diſtinction I put between Mineral Salts) they are not to be ſlightly eſteemed, nor to be rejected in Tinctures, ſince we can in no wiſe be without them, in their Compoſition, For in them lyes that moſt pretious Treaſure, from which every Fixation derives its Original.</p>
            <p>Here ſome may ask, and indeed very properly; whether ſuch a Stone can be made without matter?
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:62975:89"/>I anſwer, No. For every Thing muſt have its own Matter; but not without Diſtinction. <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals</hi> require their Matter, <hi>Vegetables</hi> theirs, and <hi>Mineralls</hi> theirs. Only conſider and before all things obſerve this; <hi>viz.</hi> that no Body can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for any Stone, without Fermentation, which I find in the end of the Work (I mean as to the Preparation of the Great Stone) cannot be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, if I would convert Metalls with gain; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in the Beginning a Corporal form, and corporal Entity, viſible and tangible is taken; yet from that formal Body muſt be extracted a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Spiritual and Celeſtial Entity (ſhall I call it) or Apparency; for I find no other more fit name to give it: which Entity was by the Stars, before infuſed into that Body, and by the Elements conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and made perfect. Yet this Spiritual Entity muſt again by a leſſer Fire, and by the <hi>Regimen</hi> and Direction of the Microcoſm, be reduced to a tangible, fixed, Solid and inconſumptible Matter.</p>
            <p>But what do I, or what do I ſpeak? I act as if I were deprived of my Reaſon,<note n="*" place="margin">Art thou well in thy Wits, <hi>Baſilius,</hi> who doest thus proſtitude the <hi>Arcanum</hi> of the Stone, which hath unto this day been ſo diligently abſconded by all Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers?

            <pb n="150" facs="tcp:62975:90"/>
            <p>All Tinctures of Metalls ought to be ſeparated, as that they may be moved with a certain princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Love and Affection to Metalls, and have a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity and deſire of uniting themſelves with them, and of reducing them to a better State. Will you have an Emblem, or Example? Behold here it is of Man and Woman. If they two be inflamed with Mutual Love, neither Delay, nor Reſt is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, until they be united, and their Deſire is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfyed: after this Union they reſt, and are mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed, according to the good pleaſure of <hi>GOD,</hi> and the promiſe of his Bleſſing.</p>
            <p>Man lives obnoxious to many and perillous Diſeaſes, ſome of which debilitate and conſume the powers of Nature ſo, as the Man can by no Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies be perfectly reſtored to Health and his former Strength. But Love is a diſeaſe, with which no other Diſeaſe may be compared, which is not hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led unleſs by Production of its own like, which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sex deſireth, and that Deſire is not ſatisfied, unleſs by fulfilling this will of the enkindled affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion. How many Teſtimonies of this violence, which is in Love, are daily found? for it not only inflames the Younger Sort, but it ſo exagitates ſome Perſons far gon in years, as through the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Heat thereof, they are almoſt mad. Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Diſeaſes are for the moſt part governed by the Complexion of Man, and therefore invade ſome more fiercely, others more gently; but Love, without diſtinction of poor or rich, young or old, ſiezeth All, and having ſeized ſo blinds them, as
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:62975:90"/>forgetting all Rules of Reaſon, they neither ſee or fear any Snare. Peculiar Members are infected with the Singular Symptomes of other Diſeaſes, all the other parts remaining ſound and free from that Dolour. Whom Love infects, it invades all over, penetrates the Body and its whole Subſtance, Form, and Eſſence, and leaves nothing unoffended. For taking place in the Heart there it kindles a Fire, the burning heat of which is diffuſed through the Veins, Arteries, and all the Members of the Body, and in a word I ſay, where Love once hath fixed its Root, the man is ſo deprived of all ſenſe, reaſon and underſtanding, as he forgets all things, ſeriouſly minds nothing; he is unmindful of <hi>GOD</hi> and his Law, his promiſes and threats he lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle regards; the torments of Hell and rewards of Eternal Life he contemns. I ſpeak of inordinate and unlawful Love, to which, if a man be once ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted, he adheres ſo pertinaciouſly, as nothing can reclaim, nothing can reſtrain him; he forgets his Duty, Calling and Condition; derides all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, deſpiſeth the Counſels of Parents, Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, and others who wiſh him well; briefly I ſay, he is ſo blind with Love, as he cannot ſee his own Miſery; ſo deaf, as he cannot hear thoſe, who by their faithful Advice, endeavour to turn and avert from him, the dammage and evil, which would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall him. Love leaves nothing intire, or ſound in the Man; it impedes his Sleep, he cannot reſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Night or Day; it takes off his Appetite, that he hath no diſpoſition either to Meat or Drink, by reaſon of the continual Torments of his Heart and Mind. It deprives him of all Providence; hence he neglects his Affairs, Vocation, and Buſineſs; he minds neither Labour, Study nor Prayer; caſts away all thoughts of any Thing but the Body belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; this is his ſtudy, this his moſt vain Occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:62975:91"/>If to Lovers the Succeſs be not anſwerable to their Wiſh, or ſo ſoon and proſperouſly as they deſire, how many Melancholies hence ariſe, with griefs and ſadneſſes, with which they pine away and wax ſo lean, as they have ſcarcely any Fleſh clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to the Bones; yea, at length they looſe the Life it ſelf, as may be proved by many Examples! For ſuch Men (which is an horrible thing to think of) ſlight and neglect all perils and detriments, both of the Body and Life, and of the Soul and Eternal Salvation.</p>
            <p>But of theſe enough; for it becomes not a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Man to inſiſt too long upon theſe Cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or to give place to ſuch a flame in his heart. Hitherto (without Boaſting I ſpeak it) I have throughout the whole courſe of my Life kept my ſelf ſafe and free from it, and I pray and invoke <hi>GOD</hi> to vouchſafe me his Grace, that I may keep holy and inviolate the Faith, which I have Sworn, and live contented with my Spiritual Spouſe, the Holy Catholick Church. For no other Reaſon have I alleaged theſe, then that I might expreſs the Love, with which all Tinctures ought to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved toward Metalls, if ever they be admitted by them into true Friendſhip, and by Love, which pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrates the inmoſt parts, be converted into a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter State.</p>
            <p>Now let us proceed to the Preparation of the Stone, and leave its uſe to the Cloſe of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. This Stone is of a penetrable and fiery Nature, is cocted and brought to Maturity by fire, no otherwiſe, then all other Things, which are found in this Orb; which notwithſtanding as they are of a divers Nature, ſo they in divers man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners obtain that, according as the Nature of Things ſupplies with divers Fires.</p>
            <p>The firſt Fire is <hi>Coeleſtial,</hi> by <hi>GOD</hi> kindled in
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:62975:91"/>our Hearts, by which being inflamed we are moved with Love and a certain confidence in and of <hi>GOD</hi> our Creator, of the Moſt Holy and Incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible <hi>Trinity,</hi> and of the Mercy, Grace of our Saviour <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST;</hi> which Confidence kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled in Us by Love, never fails, never deſerts us in our Neceſſities, but will moſt certainly deliver our Souls from everlaſting deſtruction. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Fire is Elemental, produced by the Sun, and tends to the Ripening of all things in the Macro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſm. The third Fire is corporal, with which all Foods and Medicines are cocted and prepared, without which Men can neither obtain Health of Body, nor ſuſtentation of Life. Of a fourth Fire mention is made in the Sacred Scriptures, <hi>viz.</hi> that, which before the Supream Judgment of <hi>GOD</hi> ſhall conſume this viſible World: but what Fire is, and how it ſhall operate, that (if we be wiſe) we muſt leave to be judged of by his own Supream Majeſty. A fifth Fire is alſo ſpoken of in Holy-Writ, <hi>viz.</hi> Eternal Fire, in which never to have end, the Divels ſhall never be ſet at liberty from their Infernal Priſon, and wicked Men, their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, adjudged to thoſe Eternal Fires, ſhall be vexed, puniſhed and miſerably tormented for ever: from which I pray the Omnipotent and merciful Lord to preſerve us. Here I would admoniſh all and every Creature endued with Reaſon, by their Prayers to beg that Grace and Mercy from the Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent, that they may ſo conform their Life to the Divine Precepts, and their own Duty, as that they may eſcape this Fire, and it's Eternal Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>Our ſtone of Fire (which is to be noted) muſt be cocted and ripened with Corporal Fire in the Microcoſm, as all other Medicines and Foods are prepared by the ſame. For where the great Fire
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:62975:92" rendition="simple:additions"/>of the Macrocoſm ceaſeth from it's Operation, there the Microcoſm begins to produce a new Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration; therefore this Concoction ſhould ſeem ſtrange to no Man. Corn is augmented and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened by the Elementary Fire of the Macrocoſm; but by the Corporal Fire of the Microcoſm a new Coction and maturation is effected, that man may uſe and enjoy that Divine Gift for his ſuſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and by the ſame perfect the Laſt and the Leaſt, which is produced of the Firſt and the Greateſt.</p>
            <p>The true Oyl of <hi>Antimony,</hi> of which the ſaid ſtone of Fire is made, is above meaſure ſweet, and from it's earth is in ſuch wiſe purged and ſeparated, as if a Glaſs full of it be expoſed to the Sun, it caſts forth various and wonderful Rays (as if many fiery <hi>Speculums</hi> were there preſent) reſembling a Ruby, and other Colours. Now attend O Lover of Art and Truth, and hear what I ſhall teach.</p>
            <p>Take in the Name of the Lord, of the <hi>Minera</hi> of <hi>Antimony,</hi> which grew after the Riſing of the Sun, and Salt Nitre, of each equal Parts; grind them ſubtily and mix them; burn them together with a moderate Fire very artificially and warily; for in this the principal Part of the Work conſiſts. Then you will have a matter inclining to Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Of this matter make Glaſs, grind that Glaſs to a ſubtile Pouder, and extract from it an high red Tincture with ſharp diſtilled Vinegar, which is made of it's proper <hi>Minera.</hi> Abſtract the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar in B. M. and a Pouder<note n="*" place="margin">Take heed, take heed, O Lover of Chymiſtry, leeſt by this Fire, you burn the wings of your Bird, which hath now raiſed it ſelf to the top of Mountains.

            <p>If of this Extraction you have lb. ℥ij. take of the Salt of <hi>Antimony,</hi> as I taught you to prepare it, ℥iiij. and on them pour the Extraction, and circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late them, for a whole Month at leaſt, in a Veſſel well cloſed, and the Salt will unite it ſelf with the Extracted <hi>Sulphur.</hi> If <hi>Faeces</hi> be put down, ſeparate them, and again abſtract the Spirit of Wine by <hi>B.

Rectify this Oyl againe in <hi>B. M.</hi> So that a fourth part of it may be diſtilled, and then it is prepared.</p>
            <p>This Operation being compleated, take living<note n="*" place="margin">The word, Our <hi>Mercury,</hi> which hath ſo often rendred Thee <hi>ambiguous,</hi> is alſo here to be underſtood: for if you take not the true <hi>Mercury</hi> of Philoſophers, you do nothing.

               <hi>Mercury</hi> of <hi>Antimony,</hi> which I taught you how you ſhould make, and pour upon it red Oyl of Vitriol made upon Iron, and highly rectifyed.

            <p>Now my Follower. and Diſciple of Arcanums, I will ſpeak after a Prophetick manner. When you have brought your Philoſophick Studies (in the Method by me preſcribed) to this end, you have the Medicine of Men and Metals; which is grateful and Sweet in uſe, without all peril, it is penetrative, yet cauſeth not Stools, it induceth Emendation, and expells Evil. Uſe it as is fit; and it will yeild you many Commodities, both for health, and temporal neceſſity; by which means you will be freed from want in this World; which is a thing of ſo great Moment, as no Sacrifice of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:62975:93"/>can be found ſufficient to anſwer this favour of <hi>GOD</hi> ſhewed to you.</p>
            <p>Here, O my <hi>GOD,</hi> I as a Religious Man am troubled in Mind; and know not whether I do well or ill, whether in<note n="*" place="margin">Our Author judgeth himſelf to have ſpoken too much, if you alſo think the ſame, you will rejoyce in his Sadneſs. Yet it is ſtrange, that no Man can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute a little Light to this Philoſophy, but he preſently repents.</note> ſpeaking I have exceeded or not reached the due Bounds; whilſt I propoſe, and ſhew to every One, as it were, his proper Houſe. Do thou, that art a young Follower of Art, inquire, ſearch and try, as I have done; if you attain your End, give greateſt thanks to <hi>GOD,</hi> and after him to me your Maſter. But if you turn aſide into devious and by-paths, blame your ſelf, not me; for I am not guilty of your Error.</p>
            <p>Now I have ſaid enough, and writ enough, and taught ſo clearly and openly, and plainly, as more manifeſtly or clearly cannot be done by Writing, unleſs ſome loſt and raſh Man, knowing and willingly would caſt himſelf into Hell, to be there Submerged and Periſh: Becauſe, by the Creator of all Things we are moſt ſeverely prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited further to unlock theſe Myſteries, or to eat of the Tree which was planted in the midſt of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe. Therefore here I will deſiſt, until Others ſhew, what is here to be done by Me, and what they judge is to be omitted, and ſay no more of this, but paſs to its Uſe.</p>
            <p>Therefore know, that the Uſe conſiſts in Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Perſon and his Complexion, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to what appertains to Humane Health, that Nature be not overpowered with two great a Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, or not helped by too ſmall. Yet too much is not ſo Religiouſly to be feared; for it will not
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:62975:94"/>readily hurt; becauſe it helps to recover the priſtine Sanity, and ſights againſt Venom, if any be in the Body. This I only add, three or four grains of it, given in one onely Doſe, are ſufficient for evpelling every Evil, if taken in Spirit of Wine. For this Stone or Tincture paſſeth through all the Members of the Body, and contains in it ſelf the Virtues of many <hi>Arcanums.</hi> It remedies the Gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs of the Head, and all Diſeaſes, which have their Original from the Lungs. It cures difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Breathing, and the Cough; the Leproſy and <hi>French</hi> Diſeaſe are amended by it, in a wonderful manner. The Peſt, Jaundies, Dropſies and all kinds of Fevers, are often cured by it, Likewiſe it expells Venom taken. It profits thoſe, who have drunk a <hi>Philtrum</hi> or Love-potion: it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms all the Members, Brain, Head, and all things depending thereon. It helps the Stomach and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; heals all Diſeaſes, which proceed from the Reins; cleanſeth the impurity of the Bloud. Alſo this Tincture of <hi>Antimony,</hi> breaks the Stone of the Bladder to Pouder; and expells it; it provokes Urine, when ſtopped by <hi>Flatus</hi>'s. It reſtores the vital Spirits, cures Suffocation of the Matrix, makes the Menſtrues flow if ſtopped, and ſtayes them if inordinate. It cauſeth Fruitfulneſs, and makes the Seed ſound, and avaylable for Generation, both in Women and Men. Laſtly, this Stone of Fire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly taken (convenient Plaiſters being alſo outwardly applyed) heals the Cancer, Fiſtula's, Rotteneſs in the Bones, and all corroding Ulcers, and whatſoever takes beginning from the Impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Blood, alſo the Diſeaſe it ſelf called <hi>Noli me tangere.</hi> And that I may comprehend all in few Words, this Stone, like a Particular Tincture, is a<note place="margin">Here the Medicinal Virtues are ſpoken of at large.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Thee not to be defiled with the Filths of <hi>Avarice,</hi> but ſplendid in the Light of Charity, and burning with a Deſire of helping thy Neighbour, following him diſcovering theſe Secrets. Now farewel O Lover of Chymiſtry, and if thou, haſt gained any Light, either from the Interpretation of <hi>Baſillus,</hi> or my Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, enjoy it, and communicate the ſame to the Sons of Art, that Philoſophy oppreſſed for ſo many Years with the intollerable Yoak of <hi>Avarice,</hi> may at length be revived, and a return be of thoſe times of the Egyptians, in which <hi>Triſmegiſtus</hi> and ſo many wiſe <hi>Magi,</hi> Philoſophized not with empty denominations, but with wonderful Works.</note> Remedy againſt all Symptomes, which can hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to the Humane Body. All which Experience
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:62975:94"/>will very clearly demonſtrate to you, and open the way further to you, if you be a Phyſitian, called by <hi>GOD</hi> to that Office.</p>
            <p>In theſe, I think I have done my part, and writ more then ſufficiently of <hi>Antimony.</hi> If any One followes me, he may add his own Experiences to theſe, that (with the ſingular favour of <hi>GOD</hi>) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the conſummation of the World, the Myſteries of the moſt High may be revealed, to his Glory and honour, and the Conſervation of health. Having finiſhed this Diſcourſe, I intend for a time to be ſilent and return to my Monaſtery, there to learn Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy further, that I may be able to comment of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Things and as I have already promiſed, I ſhall (<hi>GOD</hi> willing) write of Vitriol, common Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, and the Loadſtone, and open their Principle, Powers, Operations and Virtues.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let</hi> GOD <hi>the Lord of Heaven and Earth grant to us temporal Health here, and hereafter Eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation for the Refreſhment of our Souls, in the Seats of Joy and Gladneſs, never to be limited within any Bounds of time. Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I conclude this Treatiſe of <hi>Antimony,</hi> and all whatſoever I have written of the Red Oyl of <hi>Antimony,</hi> which is made of its Sulphur highly puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and of the Spirit, which is prepared of its Salt.
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:62975:95"/>Incline your Mind to thoſe, and with them compare theſe laſt, which I have preſcribed you touching the Stone of Fire. If you acutely conſider them, you may eaſily find their Union unto the End, by this Comparation. For the Foundation is the ſame, the Reaſon the ſame, the Friendſhip the ſame, by which Health is required, and the Stag long ſought taken with a pleaſant Hunting.</p>
